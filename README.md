# Smart_Reddit_App {PatientCom}:
### Examination of Digital Community Conversations Within Specific Disease States Via Reddit

<img align="center" src="img/logo.png">

### - *Vision: 
Development of a repeatable process for the analysis of Reddit conversations
within specific condition and/or disease state with applicable threads and subreddit
threads (subreddits) to potentially inform strategy and content development. Create a
simplified and repeatable process that does not require the users to be fluent in Reddit.

### - *Issue: 
While Reddit offers robust, open, and community-minded discussions surrounding
conditions and disease states, Reddit also provides volumes of unstructured and
unclassified data. The development of a repeatable process – that continues to monitor
evolving conversations over time – currently requires multiple tools (ex. – tools to scrape
threads, tools to analyze keyword content, tools to analyze sentiment, etc.).

### - *Method: 

After identifying priority conditions and/or disease states with active Reddit
communities (ex. – prostate cancer, breast cancer, HIV, etc.), build relational taxonomy
(ex. – medicine, treatment, and adherence all have specific topics but have relational
discussions) of topical themes addressed within.
- **Potential Output**: Provide use case for healthcare companies on the importance of
Reddit as an early source of social indicator of trends and conversational “lexicon” to be
used for patient communications and programs.
