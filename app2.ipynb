    "In an attempt to build an AI-ready workforce, Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud Hub which has been launched to empower the next generation of students with AI-ready skills. Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100 institutions with AI infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support, development tools and give students access to cloud and AI services. As part of the program, the Redmond giant which wants to expand its reach and is planning to build a strong developer ecosystem in India with the program will set up the core AI infrastructure and IoT Hub for the selected campuses. The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning.According to Manish Prakash, Country General Manager-PS, Health and Education, Microsoft India, said, \"With AI being the defining technology of our time, it is transforming lives and industry and the jobs of tomorrow will require a different skillset. This will require more collaborations and training and working with AI. That‚Äôs why it has become more critical than ever for educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies. The program is an attempt to ramp up the institutional set-up and build capabilities among the educators to educate the workforce of tomorrow.\" The program aims to build up the cognitive skills and in-depth understanding of developing intelligent cloud connected solutions for applications across industry. Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional Program In AI as a learning track open to the public. The program was developed to provide job ready skills to programmers who wanted to hone their skills in AI and data science with a series of online courses which featured hands-on labs and expert instructors as well. This program also included developer-focused AI school that provided a bunch of assets to help build AI skills.\n",

      "[\"You or your father might be confusing the risks of a biopsy with the risks of a prostatectomy.  Removal of the prostate carries the risk of incontinence and erectile disfunction. A biopsy does not. The only major risk of a biopsy is infection. That might be prevented by profilactic treatment with antibiotics.  \\n\\nYour dad in effect is doing watch and wait. That is relying on the PSA tests to indicate whether there is active cancer growing. If his urologist feels comfortable with that state of monitoring and your dad doesn't want to find out whether he has cancer at all, that is a viable form or non-treatment for a man his age. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 and chose to have no treatment. My cancer is monitored with PSA tests only (though recently I had by my own request, a fusion biopsy done). \\n\\nIn other words, your dad has the option of undergoing a biopsy (no big deal with very limited side effects) to find out whether he has cancer. Or, he can have an MRI (non-invasive) which can show the possibility of cancer. Or he can do nothing which is what apparently is his choice for now. **All those options are OK if his urologist agrees**\", 'At a minimum he should consider a prostate MRI. Otherwise he should consider a prostate biopsy, which does not carry the risk of incontinence.', \"I'm 60, and I found the biopsy easy and not really painful.

This can be the first step to rulo out the inflammation theory. And an ultrasound to check prostate size.\\n\\nHas the urologist performed a DRE on your dad? That also can tell a lot.\", 'Some things to think about with respect to prostate cancer.\\n\\n1] PSA is produced as long as you have a prostate. Everyone with a prostate has some background level of PSA. There are many factors that can impact your PSA level, including infections and just general prostate size. That is why PSA generally gets higher as you age, your prostate gets larger.\\n\\n2] Most prostate cancer increases the amount of PSA being produced. Generally as the cancer progresses more PSA is produced.\\n\\n3] Many prostate cancers are slow growing and indolent and don‚Äôt require any treatment.\\n\\nIts not impossible that your father has prostate cancer. He is 70. But given that his PSA is stable, if anything is going on, it is likely indolent. He should continue to monitor his PSA regularly. But what is being looked for is something that causes a drastic shift in the production of PSA. That is a strong indication that there is something unusual going on.\\n\\nSo yes, a PSA of 12 is high compared to the baseline of most people, so without any previous PSA results to provide context‚Äîthat is an indiciation for biopsy. However, everyone is different. Some people just have high stable PSAs.', 'Get a genomic marker like exodx, 4k, phi or selectmdx.']\n",

He ended up getting a low risk Gleason score and his cancer is all on one side according to his MRI. \\n\\nMost of the time, prostate cancer is a slow growing cancer and has high rates of survival!

The only way to be certain is to do a biopsy, which your dad's urologist will call for if (s)he suspects cancer.  PSA levels can vary greatly depending on all sorts of things.\\n\\nAlso - if it IS cancer, it is treatable, and the prognosis can be very good.  I had an enlarged prostate for a decade and only after having some other health problems was I tested for cancer at age 67.  The biopsy showed cancer, they urologist recommended surgery, and -- voil√†! -- cancer gone (three successive PSA tests showed less than 0.01 PSA, i.e., indiscernible, which is usually a strong sign that the cancer was removed in time).  So while concern is normal, there is no need to freak out even then.  \\n\\nThe key here will be to speak to the doctor and ask if tests other than PSA (MRI, biopsy) are warranted at this stage.  \\n\\nPlease bear in mind that prostate cancer is among the easiest to treat and that it progresses slowly (so the COVID delay probably had little to no effect if your dad does have cancer).\\n\\nBest of luck.\", \"6.8 psa is not far from normal for a 70yr old man.

It's hard, but if you play by the rules and don't put yourself at risk, your relationship will be much better and less stressful. The doctor you want to talk to about the Prep treatment is an infectious diseases doc. I found one near me who was very helpful, non judgmental, and I formative. Well, not really non judgmental, when you let someone w HIV stick their dick in you they think you are an idiot, so maybe say that the condom broke, saves a lot of explanation \", \"Is your partner on meds? are they undetectable? are they free of other STDs?\\n\\nIf so, your risk of transmission is pretty minimal and you should be safe. I would still stick with condoms just for the extra bit of security, but if it was to slip/break, it wouldn't be the end of the world.\\n\\nIf you guys are getting serious, you should see your doctor, or preferably see his doctor (assuming his doctor specializes in HIV treatment) and discuss what your options are.\\n\\nIf you do become exposed to HIV, you can do PeP treatment, which is basically you take HIV meds within 72 hours of exposure for some time (few weeks), and has a pretty high success rate of preventing transmission.\\n\\nThere is also PreP --- which is much like PeP, but you basically take Truvada (an HIV med), daily - and it can prevent you from becoming positive. To me, it seems kind of silly to 'take an HIV medication every day for the rest of my life (with my partner) to prevent needing to take the same HIV medication every day of my life if I became HIV+' -- if your partner is on meds and undetectable, it's probably not worth it.\\n\\nSee if your city has any hassle free / anonymous testing / sexual health / planned parent hood type places - they might be able to provide you with more information than just your standard walk-in doctor.\", \"Taking medications is the most effective method of keeping you safe after using condoms.  If he is undetectable, he is less likely to transmit the virus to you.  If you use condoms and he takes medications, and there are no other STD's present, your chances of contracting HIV are very low.  \\n\\nAll in all, anything you can do to reduce your exposure to his semen (or blood if you're into that) will reduce your risk of contracting HIV.  Oral sex is safer than anal sex.  Topping is safer than bottoming (though some people argue this, it's pretty well accepted in the HIV medical world).  Having him pull out before he cums if you're not using condoms, etc.  Reduce the amount (both volume and frequency) of exposure to blood & semen and you reduce your chance of contracting it. \\n\\nGood luck and good on you for not running when he told you his status!\"]\n",

HIV does not live long outside the body. A man's penis is only exposed to HIV for the time that it is in a vagina or rectum. Men also may have fewer areas on the penis where the virus can enter the body. HIV can enter at the opening of the tip and through cuts or sores on the shaft. But if a partner has an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia, the risk is higher. These infections can bring more CD4 cells to the area of infection, or cause breaks in the skin, both increasing the risk of passing HIV. Meanwhile, women have a higher risk of getting HIV from men. Because HIV is in the man's semen, which can stay in the woman's vagina for days, her exposure time is longer after sex. Also, the vagina provides a much larger area than the penis does through which HIV can enter the woman's body.\\nI am also an outreach worker and HIV Counseling and Testing is part of my job.

This anxiety itself could very easily cause a few of the symptoms you mentioned...\\n\\nHere's a few things to consider:\\n\\nIt is unlikely that you have HIV.  HIV isn't that easy to get.  Obviously it's not impossible, but the odds of you getting HIV from the activities you described are fairly low.\\n\\nYour initial two week test came back negative.  This is a very good thing.  Again, it's not definitive, but in combination with the low risk activities you described, it strengthens the case against HIV. \\n\\nFollow your Dr's instructions.  Get a test at 3 or 6 months just to be sure. But don't stress over it.\\n\\nFinally...\\n\\nIf you did get HIV it would not be the end of the world.  I work with dozens of people every single day who have HIV and they're, for the most part, healthy and happy people. They have to be careful with sex and other body fluid related stuff.  They have to take pills every day and those pills can have different side effects.  The newer generation of pills has fewer of those. The cost of the medications and medical care are taken care of by Ryan White funds for those who can't afford it (In the US).  It is not only possible to live a full life with HIV, with good medication adherence and a healthy lifestyle, it's become the norm. \\n\\nIt would be an adjustment, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.  So with that knowledge, release that fear.  You aren't facing a death sentence...regardless of your diagnosis.\\n\\nBut, as I said, the likelihood that you've been infected with HIV is pretty low.\\n\\nStop having unprotected oral sex with prostitutes.

No test at Day 6 for Herpes or anything else should be considered conclusive.\\n\\n2. Your Doctor giving you antivirals at Day 6 is a stretch by him.  By Day 6 post-exposure, antivirals would have low efficacy as a PEP intervention.  The usual criteria is no later than 48-72 hours after exposure for expected efficacy.  Don\\'t let these words stop you from taking antivirals, of course!  Take the regimen if that is your intent - it still has value, but commit to taking it completely or don\\'t take it.\\n\\n3.

This is my way of saying, \"I\\'m not saying it\\'s in your head, but...\"\\n\\nIf you had HIV, you wouldn\\'t feel bad for another couple weeks at minimum - it takes that long before your body starts churning out antibodies in numbers.

Be true to your wants and needs and conditions of enjoyment and you\\'ll feel better after future encounters, even if that means a hookup doesn\\'t end up happening.\\n\\n**On Testing**\\n\\nYou can get an RNA test usually through your physician.\\n\\nThat said, the rapid tests are 90th-percentile accurate at about 3 weeks.  The 90-day thing is old news (but still good policy and that\\'s why it\\'s kept around).  The rapid tests may look and act the same, but they\\'ve evolved over the years and now they\\'re very sensitive nowadays.\\n\\nGet a pinprick test rapid test or blood draw (both better than ~~nasal~~ *cheek* swab) after Day 21.  Then again at Day 35 and again at Day 90.  Unless you have cancer or lupus or something (in which case you got bigger problems), Day 21 will provide you significant breathing room with a mid-90s certainty, and Day 35 will be nearly-definitive.\\n\\nI used to be like you in so many ways (and in some ways still am.)  Please keep seeing your therapist and aim to build healthy relationships in your life *and with yourself.*  Honor your value and worth, and try your best to own who you are and what you do.  It\\'s hard for many people to do this - including myself - but almost more important than succeeding at doing it, is understanding why you fail at doing it.  Recognizing your shortcomings and anxieties and triggers and why we look for sex where we do (and allow ourselves to do it with people who are lower than our standards should permit), is a huge step to putting life and one\\'s actions and motivations into perspective.\\n\\nFinally, I would suggest that knowledge is power, but not putting that knowledge into context is devastating.  Keep reading up more on STIs and HIV and what-not, but for heaven\\'s sake, stay away from WebMD and other self-diagnosis sites.  Know how HIV therapy and prevention has evolved over the last decade and understand that tools multiple tools exist to ease your anxiety on the subject - again, Knowledge being one of them.  PrEP is another.  I would also suggest you get to know someone with HIV as well.  Not to complete your \"human trading card\" collection, but because it will help you humanize the condition. It doesn\\'t define people.
