- **Vision**: Development of a repeatable process for the analysis of Reddit conversations
within specific condition and/or disease state with applicable threads and subreddit
threads (subreddits) to potentially inform strategy and content development. Create a
simplified and repeatable process that does not require the users to be fluent in Reddit.
- **Issue**: While Reddit offers robust, open, and community-minded discussions surrounding
conditions and disease states, Reddit also provides volumes of unstructured and
unclassified data. The development of a repeatable process ‚Äì that continues to monitor
evolving conversations over time ‚Äì currently requires multiple tools (ex. ‚Äì tools to scrape
threads, tools to analyze keyword content, tools to analyze sentiment, etc.).
- **Method**: After identifying priority conditions and/or disease states with active Reddit
communities (ex. ‚Äì prostate cancer, breast cancer, HIV, etc.), build relational taxonomy
(ex. ‚Äì medicine, treatment, and adherence all have specific topics but have relational
discussions) of topical themes addressed within.
- **Potential Output**: Provide use case for healthcare companies on the importance of
Reddit as an early source of social indicator of trends and conversational ‚Äúlexicon‚Äù to be
used for patient communications and programs.

In an attempt to build an AI-ready workforce, Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud Hub which has been launched to empower the next generation of students with AI-ready skills. Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100 institutions with AI infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support, development tools and give students access to cloud and AI services. As part of the program, the Redmond giant which wants to expand its reach and is planning to build a strong developer ecosystem in India with the program will set up the core AI infrastructure and IoT Hub for the selected campuses. The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning.According to Manish Prakash, Country General Manager-PS, Health and Education, Microsoft India, said, "With AI being the defining technology of our time, it is transforming lives and industry and the jobs of tomorrow will require a different skillset. This will require more collaborations and training and working with AI. That‚Äôs why it has become more critical than ever for educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies. The program is an attempt to ramp up the institutional set-up and build capabilities among the educators to educate the workforce of tomorrow." The program aims to build up the cognitive skills and in-depth understanding of developing intelligent cloud connected solutions for applications across industry. Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional Program In AI as a learning track open to the public. The program was developed to provide job ready skills to programmers who wanted to hone their skills in AI and data science with a series of online courses which featured hands-on labs and expert instructors as well. This program also included developer-focused AI school that provided a bunch of assets to help build AI skills.

    	+ Because Reddit is regarded as one of the most effective social network sources for tracking the prevalence of public interests in infectious diseases (e.g., Coronavirus, HIV, and cancer) and controversial health-related issues (e.g., electronic cigarettes and marijuana) over time, reporting on findings derived from social media data nowadays becomes critical for understanding public reactions to infectious diseases. 

        + As a result, we require a faster, more intelligent, and more accurate sentiment analyzer and web scrapper-based engine capable of tracking the latest trends on novel diseases, as well as any conversational "lexicon."
        
        + This will serve as a social indicator, providing a collection of use cases for healthcare companies to sensitize consumers through various mediums, communications, and programs to learn about either polemics or significant takeaways from what is happening in social media.
