1,Are you posting here because you think you may have contracted HIV?,17,18ywmb,HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/18ywmb/are_you_posting_here_because_you_think_you_may/,25,"A large majority of the questions on this subreddit are people wanting to know if they could have contracted HIV in an extremely low-risk sexual encounter.  Let me be clear:  HIV is not easy to catch.  Very rarely does someone contract HIV from one sexual encounter with an HIV positive person (although it can happen).  Bottoming for condom-less anal sex where someone cums in your ass would be a fairly risky sexual act.  Bottoming for condom-less vaginal sex where someone cums in your vagina can also be fairly risky.  Men are much less likely to contract HIV from a woman.  Oral sex is considered low risk.  Any kind of sex with a condom is considered low risk.  Decreasing your exposure to semen or vaginal secretions decreases your risk of contracting HIV.  If you one time performed oral sex on a woman and you think you contracted HIV because you may have had a small canker sore in your mouth, or you topped someone with a condom and later heard he might have HIV, or you gave someone a  blow job and they didn't cum in your mouth, but WHAT IF!!??!!??, then you probably need to do two things more than you need an HIV test: 1) Stop putting yourself in any kind of ""what if"" situation and always use condoms and lube during all sexual encounters; and 2) **Go to a counselor and get treatment for your anxiety.** 

Your anxiety is presenting itself in the package of HIV, but you are probably anxious about a lot of things.  You probably worry about things all the time.  You probably need to get some counseling or start medication to treat your anxiety.  These things can help you deal with your anxiety so you're not constantly worried.

I have seen these posts and responded to a few of them. \n\nYes, I think there should be a FAQ or at the very least a link to a decent article on levels of risk such as http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/basic/#spread\n\nHowever, talk of deleting the posts crosses a line into doing harm.\n\nThe people who come here asking these questions are suffering and they are legitimately afraid.  Having been a young gay man who knew little about HIV/AIDS in the late 80s and early 90s, I can relate to this fear on a visceral level. \n\nThe answer isn\'t abandonment, it\'s education. \n\nSo a nice FAQ, and a few people who are willing to provide advice to those who ask should help a bit.\n\nFrankly, the attitude of ""If I keep seeing this I\'m going to unsubscribe"" sickens me. If these posts offend you so much, then hide them or don\'t click on them or don\'t respond to them. Simple as that.

I can say with certainty that anxiety is very capable of creating allot of your 'symptoms'. It'll leave you a mess. The only real way to relieve you of your crippling anxiety is to get tested with the most accurate test you can get your hands on, so you can't ask what if. \n\nIf you have a serious risk get tested at 6 weeks and again at 3 months, with a third or four generation Elisa. And if you had a major risk go to your nearest ER ASAP after the encounter and get on preventative drugs, not tomorrow or the day after, immediately! You only have a tiny window of 72 hours post exposure, the sooner the better though. I'd also recommend you go the hospital in your area that has the most experience with HIV exposure and research if possible, they will have access to the most current knowledge and research and assess your risk better.

Yet anxiety don't work that way, and perhaps it's should be considered like a disease itself. \n\nI've had extreme stress anxiety since 3 years ago, which gave me horrible urticaria, eczema, sleep deprivation, extreme weight loss and more that sometimes can take up to a month. \n\n I'm still scared (and I'll be scared until I receive my test results) but through a lot of effort I've managed to keep myself together and searching relief in more informed people than me has helped. Even started considering that if even against all odds my test results came positive, it's perhaps something that I can live with, and seeing the struggle that people with HIV do has helped me to rationalize my fear and remind me that even if everything  goes wrong, living it's worth the effort.\n\nSo please, bear with us, we may be annoying, but you aren't in our shoes.

4 years ago I had unprotected vaginal sex with an escort. To be specific, she was a very unhealthy looking street prostitute. Easily the dumbest decision I’ve ever made.

About 3 weeks after I felt a strange pain in penis/groin area and freaked out. I hit tested for hiv and chlamidia/gon and was negative. I then felt a lot of fatigue for the next 6 weeks or so.

I tested again at 7 weeks and then 12 weeks with 4the gen test. Negative.

Was still paranoid due to some strange symptoms. Burning sensation in face and arms. Muscle aches. Face turned a shade of red and noticed Seb Derm around month 5.

Got tested full panel at 6 mths and negative for everything.

Been tormenting myself ever since and have done 4th gen tests at 1 year, and most recently at 3 years.

Go to the ER and tell them you think you were exposed and that you need PEP (post exposure prophylaxis).  Your symptoms could be the flu-- or a cold-- or acute HIV.

My boyfriend found out he was positive right as we were getting together, so we went to his doctor to ask for advice. There are three things you should do:\n\n1- Get his viral load at undetectable if it's not already there. He and his doctor need to figure out which meds he needs, and then he needs to adhere to the regimen.  \n\n2- Minimize your exposure to his fluids. I wouldn't use the same razor, toothbrush, or contact lenses. Kissing and oral exposure to his semen aren't likely to transmit HIV unless you have a sore or cut in your mouth. Use condoms for anal. Although his blood viral load may be undetectable, his semen viral load may not be. He may also have small blips in his viral load that may make the virus slightly more transmissible. \n\n3- Look into prophylactic Truvada. I just began that recently and haven't experienced any side effects (except for vivid dreams, which aren't bad). My doctor told me I can either take this on a daily basis or take it for a couple of days after a suspected exposure. I have elected to take it every day. This is now an FDA-approved use of Truvada, so your health insurance should cover most of the cost of it. I wind up paying only about $60/month after my medication deductible is covered. It's worth it for the peace of mind. "", 'http://betablog.org/one-mans-year-on-prep/', ""I'm in the same situation for over a year now. In love w the most amazing man.

It's hard, but if you play by the rules and don't put yourself at risk, your relationship will be much better and less stressful. The doctor you want to talk to about the Prep treatment is an infectious diseases doc. I found one near me who was very helpful, non judgmental, and I formative. Well, not really non judgmental, when you let someone w HIV stick their dick in you they think you are an idiot, so maybe say that the condom broke, saves a lot of explanation "", ""Is your partner on meds? are they undetectable? are they free of other STDs?\n\nIf so, your risk of transmission is pretty minimal and you should be safe. I would still stick with condoms just for the extra bit of security, but if it was to slip/break, it wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nIf you guys are getting serious, you should see your doctor, or preferably see his doctor (assuming his doctor specializes in HIV treatment) and discuss what your options are.\n\nIf you do become exposed to HIV, you can do PeP treatment, which is basically you take HIV meds within 72 hours of exposure for some time (few weeks), and has a pretty high success rate of preventing transmission.\n\nThere is also PreP --- which is much like PeP, but you basically take Truvada (an HIV med), daily - and it can prevent you from becoming positive. To me, it seems kind of silly to 'take an HIV medication every day for the rest of my life (with my partner) to prevent needing to take the same HIV medication every day of my life if I became HIV+' -- if your partner is on meds and undetectable, it's probably not worth it.\n\nSee if your city has any hassle free / anonymous testing / sexual health / planned parent hood type places - they might be able to provide you with more information than just your standard walk-in doctor."", ""Taking medications is the most effective method of keeping you safe after using condoms.

Oral sex is safer than anal sex.  Topping is safer than bottoming (though some people argue this, it's pretty well accepted in the HIV medical world).  Having him pull out before he cums if you're not using condoms, etc.  Reduce the amount (both volume and frequency) of exposure to blood & semen and you reduce your chance of contracting it. \n\nGood luck and good on you for not running when he told you his status!""]",14

HIV does not live long outside the body. A man's penis is only exposed to HIV for the time that it is in a vagina or rectum. Men also may have fewer areas on the penis where the virus can enter the body. HIV can enter at the opening of the tip and through cuts or sores on the shaft. But if a partner has an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia, the risk is higher. These infections can bring more CD4 cells to the area of infection, or cause breaks in the skin, both increasing the risk of passing HIV. Meanwhile, women have a higher risk of getting HIV from men. Because HIV is in the man's semen, which can stay in the woman's vagina for days, her exposure time is longer after sex. Also, the vagina provides a much larger area than the penis does through which HIV can enter the woman's body.\nI am also an outreach worker and HIV Counseling and Testing is part of my job.

I been living with HIV for 13 years now. This is one of my 1st post about my life I live with HIV.

In 2000 I met a girl that ended up being a needle user, I try to stop her from the drugs but in the end she pick the drugs over me. In 2001 I met another woman, very much better in not being a junkie. She end up leaving me when I found out I had HIV... 13 years later, no AIDS or sickness, no nothing in my health. My Tcells count is 430 and my Vload is 1400 as of right now. I never been on any HIV/AIDS meds ever.

23,Questions about my HIV Test. Please help! (xpost /STD),6,17zp6v,HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/17zp6v/questions_about_my_hiv_test_please_help_xpost_std/,14,"So some back story so you guys know where I am coming from. On January 16th I had a sexual encounter with a female escort. I arrived at her house and we started to have sexual intercourse. She performed oral sex on me unprotected and then had protected sex with me. We also kissed for about 10 seconds. Stupid thing is I decided to go down on her after and perform oral sex on this female. The room was barely lit but from what I could see I could not see anything wrong with her genital region. There were no warts or cuts and I could not feel anything out of the ordinary. This went on for about 2 mins and then I decided to perform the 69 position with her. During this position I performed oral sex on her and by accident swallowed some of her vaginal fluid. She was also spitting into a cup as she was giving me oral sex, which I found very odd. After we had protected sex and I left. The next day after when I went to go brush my teeth I noticed a blemish on the top and bottoms of my lip. They seem to be several maybe 20-30 white little spots clustered together under the skin. I was very concerned and told a friend about it. He said that it probably was a cold sore and recommended using Lipactin from a local drug store. I used this for about 2 days and found no results. During that 2nd day of the use I started to feel flu like symptoms. I had a sore throat and had trouble sleeping. I would get the chills in the middle of the night. So on January 20th I decided to go in to the walk-in clinic (as I did not have a family doctor) and the doctor diagnosed me for strep throat. She took 3 different swabs, checking for throat gonorrhea, throat chlamydia and strep. As she finished this she prescribed me antibiotics (Penicillin) to take 2 tablets twice daily and just to apply alcohol to my blemishes on my lip. She always advised me to call Public Health Services to get tested. The next day after I went to another doctor for my lip just to see what they had to say. This doctor prescribed me Zovirax Ointment. I used the ointment until it was finished like the doctor said but found no results. During this week I finished my antibiotics and felt as good as new but still had my blemish the same size as I had it the first day. On January 29th I went to go get tested for Herpes Simplex Virus, Hep B, HIV, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia through blood and urine samples. The doctors there said it would take about two weeks for the results to come in. So where I stand now is on February 2nd. Today I went into the doctors as I felt my throat acting up again feeling like it was sore or swollen again. The walk in clinic doctor said I should be fine and probably isn't Herpes, since I've had it for more than 2 weeks and it hasn't opened up yet. His guess was it could of just been a skin reaction to her vagina. I highly doubt that it would be since the blemish looks so different from everything else I've ever seen. I also asked him if it was ok if I kissed anyone while I had these blemishes and he said it was ok as long as I took care of it. [Stopped smoking, stopped eating spicy foods and no alcohol] He also said to apply vaseline on my lips. So the doctor checked my throat and found nothing wrong but I know for a fact that it is hard to swallow food or drink water as of right now. It feels like the first time I had started feeling symptoms of strep.

So basically I just want to know: What these blemishes on my lip could be, and how could I treat them. What are the chances of me contracting an STD orally. And what are the chances of contracting HIV through oral sex with this partner.

I feel very scared and vulnerable at this point. Every night since I had these symptoms its been hard to keep this off my mind. I am constantly thinking about it and searching on the net for more information. Every night it is hard for me to sleep thinking about this. I usually wake up around 3 or 4 am and just can't sleep. I've been to 4 doctors and still don't have solid information. I hope you Redditors can help me out. Thanks in advance.

**I copy pasted most of the information from my post on /r/STD . But now my main concern is really the HIV test that I got back. How accurate is my HIV test. I took a 4th generation HIV combo test (HIV1/2Ag/Ab) and no HIV p24 antigen and no HIV1/2 antibodies were detected.**

*My results came back negative.*

 I got tested exactly 2 weeks after I was suspicious of catching an STD or HIV. Does anyone know when I should go in for testing again just to make sure? I researched the internet that the 4th gen test detects the antibodies as early as 1-4 weeks after infection and for the safe side I should go in at 6 week mark. So what I am basically asking is, should I feel at ease now that the test came back negative after 2 weeks or should I still have a little concern until I take that 6 week test. As I am writing this I have severe stomach pains and I am having the feeling of vomiting. If someone could please respond with a little information I would be very happy and appreciative.** It is really hard to cope with this. My doctor said a 3 month test or even a 6 month test will be way more accurate. But as I said I don't know if I could deal with all this anxiety, stress and symptoms until then. I don't know anymore. I thought I was a strong person. I broke down today and cried over this whole ordeal. For christ sake I am only 20 years old and this is happening over the span of my birthday which is on the 18th of February. If anyone could please tell me anything, I would greatly appreciate it. ",2013-02-06 09:14:01+00:00,"['The results are very accurate, you should get tested every 3 months as that is the size of the current window period, it could just be a coincidence with the timing  as HIV symtoms take some time to show up it could be a form of strep Penicillin will not do shit for it in most cases,( i have been their it sucks).\nso here are a few thing you can do to ease your mind\n1 if you are still having problems swallowing I would sugest seeing an ENT  they specialize in tat department \n2 if you still have the sores ask your doctor to have cultures sent out that will tell you exactly what you are dealing with if it is CA MRSA ask for bactrim\n\n3 find your state in this list http://hab.hrsa.gov/gethelp/statehotlines.html they will find you someone to talk to.  ', ""One thing that should put you at ease is that HIV is not going to show symptoms as quickly as you saw them. At the very least it would take a week for the virus to load in your system enough to cause flu-like symptoms. Usually it takes between 2 weeks and a few months. \n\nSo if you are basing your suspicions of infection on the spots in your mouth (24 hours later) and the flu-like symptoms (3 days later). These symptoms are unlikely to have been caused by an HIV infection from this partner. You were diagnosed with Strep.  That symptom is explained.\n\nYou seem to be experiencing a great deal of anxiety over this.  This anxiety itself could very easily cause a few of the symptoms you mentioned...\n\nHere's a few things to consider:\n\nIt is unlikely that you have HIV.  HIV isn't that easy to get.  Obviously it's not impossible, but the odds of you getting HIV from the activities you described are fairly low.\n\nYour initial two week test came back negative.  This is a very good thing.  Again, it's not definitive, but in combination with the low risk activities you described, it strengthens the case against HIV. \n\nFollow your Dr's instructions.  Get a test at 3 or 6 months just to be sure. But don't stress over it.\n\nFinally...\n\nIf you did get HIV it would not be the end of the world.  I work with dozens of people every single day who have HIV and they're, for the most part, healthy and happy people. They have to be careful with sex and other body fluid related stuff.  They have to take pills every day and those pills can have different side effects.  The newer generation of pills has fewer of those. The cost of the medications and medical care are taken care of by Ryan White funds for those who can't afford it (In the US).  It is not only possible to live a full life with HIV, with good medication adherence and a healthy lifestyle, it's become the norm. \n\nIt would be an adjustment, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.  So with that knowledge, release that fear.  You aren't facing a death sentence...regardless of your diagnosis.\n\nBut, as I said, the likelihood that you've been infected with HIV is pretty low.\n\nStop having unprotected oral sex with prostitutes.  That's just a bad choice. Keep seeing the doc about your symptoms...it's possible that your strep is back...see the doc about that.  I have no idea what to tell you about your lip sores. ""]",24

Which tbh I understand because it can definitely cause anxiety in both me and the other person, even though scientifically we know it cannot be transmitted. It's just something that is already being controlled the best it can be. But I also feel it does need to be disclosed at some point if I want to continue having relations with someone.

I met this guy on a dating app and I thought he cared about me and I trusted him, after talking on and off for a few months I went to his house for sex. I asked multiple times if he has any std or hiv and he said no. I even inspected his dick and mouth before I touched him. He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules, god I hope that’s what it was. He also had a white tongue, and he had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide. Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit. After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again, I thought it was a joke. It was dark in the room but I looked and I think I seen the condom still on when he pulled out. Oh and the next morning he texted me to say he felt no connection with me and he wished we just stayed friends and I haven’t spoken to him since. I’m so fucking scared that he knew he had something and gave it to me on purpose. I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse. The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening. I’m going today to get a blood test. Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands. Mostly in the bridge of my feet, heels and toes but also in my hands and wrists. I know it’s a weird symptom but I googled it and it said it might be a symptom of a viral infection. I hope he didn’t infect me with hiv or something else. I have no flu symptoms, just the weird burning in feet and pain in my vagina where he touched me. Maybe some tingling on my lip where he kissed me but that comes and goes. Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again. I feel like my world is falling apart. I don’t usually use Reddit but I’ve been reading this thread everyday for a few days and it’s been helping with the emotional support knowing there’s other people going through the same thing. Sometimes I just feel so alone.

The uncertainty and what he said to me is what bothers me the most.. I keep replaying this night over in my memory, and I can’t get those words he said to me out of my head. I talked to my therapist a couple days ago and that did help ease the anxiety for a little bit but it always comes right back. I guess I didn’t realize just how fucked up this situation was until I started taking to people about it. I just keep thinking about it all day everyday.

If you think something\'s wrong, you\'ll find it. Please keep that in mind. \n\nAlso keep in mind that for women, UTIs are a frequent friend, especially sexually active ones.  It could coincidental or simply a normal result of your having sex.  Or it could be nothing.  But consider turning up your acidity all the same.  Cranberry Juice.\n\n> I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse.\n\n1. No test at Day 6 for Herpes or anything else should be considered conclusive.\n\n2. Your Doctor giving you antivirals at Day 6 is a stretch by him.  By Day 6 post-exposure, antivirals would have low efficacy as a PEP intervention.  The usual criteria is no later than 48-72 hours after exposure for expected efficacy.  Don\'t let these words stop you from taking antivirals, of course!  Take the regimen if that is your intent - it still has value, but commit to taking it completely or don\'t take it.\n\n3. As for your symptoms ""getting worse,"" if you had an STI, it wouldn\'t really work that way this early in the game.  This is my way of saying, ""I\'m not saying it\'s in your head, but...""\n\nIf you had HIV, you wouldn\'t feel bad for another couple weeks at minimum - it takes that long before your body starts churning out antibodies in numbers.  (That\'s kinda the whole deal with HIV and its staying power - it takes too long for the body to start fighting back that by then, HIV is already setting up shop and entrenching itself.)\n\n>Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again.\n\nSee everything I\'ve said above.  Your anxiety is through the roof and it\'s causing a lot of the tingling you\'re reporting.  It and your constant inspection is *causing you to feel (or think you feel) that your parts are irritated*!  Keep sticking your finger up your nose and you\'ll swear it\'s always bleeding on its own.\n\n> I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested. \n\nYou don\'t know anything about him.  It\'s clear.  And that\'s not an insult to you, that\'s just me saying ""stop drawing conclusions one way or the other.""\n\n>I just trusted him and made the biggest mistake of my life.\n\nDon\'t trust your rando hookups.  Period.  But do just enjoy the dick.  \n\nMake the decisions you need to make to keep yourself comfortable and sane.  If the dick doesn\'t want to cooperate, find another.\n\nThe only mistake you will make when having sex is compromising what makes you feel comfortable.\n\nDon\'t think sex is a mistake or have some hindsight beatup session on yourself.  Be true to your wants and needs and conditions of enjoyment and you\'ll feel better after future encounters, even if that means a hookup doesn\'t end up happening.\n\n**On Testing**\n\nYou can get an RNA test usually through your physician.\n\nThat said, the rapid tests are 90th-percentile accurate at about 3 weeks.  The 90-day thing is old news (but still good policy and that\'s why it\'s kept around).  The rapid tests may look and act the same, but they\'ve evolved over the years and now they\'re very sensitive nowadays.\n\nGet a pinprick test rapid test or blood draw (both better than ~~nasal~~ *cheek* swab) after Day 21.  Then again at Day 35 and again at Day 90.  Unless you have cancer or lupus or something (in which case you got bigger problems), Day 21 will provide you significant breathing room with a mid-90s certainty, and Day 35 will be nearly-definitive.\n\nI used to be like you in so many ways (and in some ways still am.)  Please keep seeing your therapist and aim to build healthy relationships in your life *and with yourself.*  Honor your value and worth, and try your best to own who you are and what you do.  It\'s hard for many people to do this - including myself - but almost more important than succeeding at doing it, is understanding why you fail at doing it.  Recognizing your shortcomings and anxieties and triggers and why we look for sex where we do (and allow ourselves to do it with people who are lower than our standards should permit), is a huge step to putting life and one\'s actions and motivations into perspective.\n\nFinally, I would suggest that knowledge is power, but not putting that knowledge into context is devastating.  Keep reading up more on STIs and HIV and what-not, but for heaven\'s sake, stay away from WebMD and other self-diagnosis sites.  Know how HIV therapy and prevention has evolved over the last decade and understand that tools multiple tools exist to ease your anxiety on the subject - again, Knowledge being one of them.  PrEP is another.  I would also suggest you get to know someone with HIV as well.  Not to complete your ""human trading card"" collection, but because it will help you humanize the condition. It doesn\'t define people.  And that goes a long way to making you feel more comfortable with the subject.', "">It’s now been 12 days since possible exposure and the anxiety has been non stop constant crying and I can’t eat or sleep. I met this guy on a dating app and I thought he cared about me and I trusted him, after talking on and off for a few months I went to his house for sex. I asked multiple times if he has any std or hiv and he said no. I even inspected his dick and mouth before I touched him. He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules, god I hope that’s what it was.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He also had a white tongue, and he had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide. Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit. After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again, I thought it was a joke. It was dark in the room but I looked and I think I seen the condom still on when he pulled out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Oh and the next morning he texted me to say he felt no connection with me and he wished we just stayed friends and I haven’t spoken to him since. I’m so fucking scared that he knew he had something and gave it to me on purpose. I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse. The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I’m going today to get a blood test. Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands. Mostly in the bridge of my feet, heels and toes but also in my hands and wrists. I know it’s a weird symptom but I googled it and it said it might be a symptom of a viral infection. I hope he didn’t infect me with hiv or something else. I have no flu symptoms, just the weird burning in feet and pain in my vagina where he touched me. Maybe some tingling on my lip where he kissed me but that comes and goes. Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I feel like my world is falling apart. I don’t usually use Reddit but I’ve been reading this thread everyday for a few days and it’s been helping with the emotional support knowing there’s other people going through the same thing. Sometimes I just feel so alone. And I feel ashamed and embarrassed my face turns red just thinking about it, I’m really convinced he infected me with something but I guess I won’t know for sure until I’m tested again. The uncertainty and what he said to me is what bothers me the most..\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I keep replaying this night over in my memory, and I can’t get those words he said to me out of my head. I talked to my therapist a couple days ago and that did help ease the anxiety for a little bit but it always comes right back. I guess I didn’t realize just how fucked up this situation was until I started taking to people about it. I just keep thinking about it all day everyday. And if he did purposefully infect me I know I’m going to have a hard time proving it, I get tested regularly and always came back negative, I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I just trusted him and made the biggest mistake of my life.

We’ve been broken up for 5 months now and i mean i’ve gotten sick but no other crazy symptoms. should i be okay or should i get tested?

43,Needing support,6,18klkm,HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/18klkm/needing_support/,3," Hey guys,
 
HIV/AIDS was not even on my radar until the past couple of months when my friend kept stressing for me to get tested. As a 20 year-old gay male, the thought of HIV settled in my head and has caused nothing but stress and anxiety since. I have had unprotected sex with two men the past year, both who have claimed to be HIV negative; however, with my boyfriend of 5 months who was a virgin before we met, I can no longer carry the burden of possibly endangering his life. Especially as us both being in the closet in regards to family life.
 
The past year I have been healthy with no ARS symptoms whatsoever. There have been a couple strange things though.
 
Dry, patchy, itchy skin along my neck and face. These patches came and went for a period of 3 or so months. They only existed when I was at school and would disappear after only a couple days of being at home with my family. I concluded that it was perhaps something to do with the water or another allergen within my apartment. My skin is perfectly normal now.
Tonsil stones. Disgusting little things. I recently started having at least one a day or more for a while now... Throat feels fine and looks okay. I had tonsillitis in the last year and went to the doctor to get diagnosed. Everything was in order and the doctor had no other suspicions. Tonsil stones are still a disgusting part of my everyday life even today.
Ear infection. Never had one until last year. Came and went in a week or so. No other symptoms besides feeling deaf in one ear, haha.
 
I have already discussed the matter with my boyfriend. He comforted me saying that there have been poz/neg couples and it can work and that how if he was also positive, it didn't even matter then. He promised he'd love me either way and that he could not be angry at me. I just hope that if I am positive, this be the case.
 
I went to get tested a few days ago through my school's free testing program. Guess how long I have to wait for results? 2-3 weeks. 2-3 weeks of agony and worrying. What a broken system this is. Anywho, I decided to bite the bullet and get tested because it is the responsible thing to do.
 
Another person who I had unprotected sex with (I both topped and bottomed) a handful of times got tested about 1 month ago. I told him to keep in touch and he called to let me know he was negative. Although comforting, his results are not entirely conclusive to my own case. My boyfriend and I have had unprotected sex... many times. He has exhibited no signs of an infection and has been perfectly healthy the entirety of our relationship thus far with no ARS.
 
If it's relevant, I took Accutane last year as well where there was routine blood work. This blood work (to my understanding) does not test for STDs or HIV; however, it does monitor other irregularities in blood work. Each doctors visit went smoothly and I was healthy in that respect.
 
I'm not sure how worried I should be. I came here to get things off my chest and make myself feel a little better. I think the worst part of it all is wondering what consequences I may face by endangering my boyfriend's life as well as mine. There's just so much to dwell on! I'm not sure how to make time go any faster. I just want to hear my results and move on. I want to feel safe but it's hard when you know you've made unwise decisions in the past.
 
Can anyone give me their thoughts/opinions? Should I be worried? Is it likely I have HIV? Thanks a ton!",2013-02-15 07:54:50+00:00,"[""Getting HIV isn't as easy as you might think.\n\nHowever, you can make it even harder by making sure that you use condoms every time you're with anyone whose status you aren't certain of. \n\nYou can get a rapid test.

I'll tell you my story to put it in context (I'm 21M). Three weeks ago I stayed to see a friend (19F) with whom I had a relationship a few years ago and we ended up as good friends (We were both virgins) and after that she was with some people in another relationship and all that. We met at my house and I had my first time. The problem came because I had a hard time keeping an erection, by this time I had already touched her clit a little with my fingertips for less than 2 minutes (no penetration). We started and lacked a lot of lubrication, moments later I lost my erection again and I took off the condom and then I touched my penis to stimulate myself without having washed my hands before, I put on another condom and we continued for a few minutes (maybe seconds). We decided not to continue and she was going to help me finish with her hand, but it hurt a little and I thought I was missing lub, so I touched the outside of the condom again, I removed it a little to see if there was lub and touched my glans with my finger to check if there was enough, everything was fine so I put it back on but it did not continue. Two days later I started with symptoms of a cystitis and after a self examination I found three small ulcers in a vertical row on the shaft but these are almost not visible because they are not deep, it looks like it was from friction as it looks (yes, I still have it) as if a layer of skin has been lifted, I went to the doctor and he did not tell me anything bad about the ulcers and gave me medication but the cystitis did not go away, the following week I went again and now it was injections, everything was fine for a few days, I felt perfect but from Wednesday to today I have had intermittent fever, I feel very tired and weak (I have not been able to sleep very well) a little runny nose but without being congested, pain behind the eyes, poop a little watery but not runny, my arm bones ache and it hurts a little to move them, chills, scabs inside my nose, red rash around my nose but it goes away a little with normal cream, a lot of sweating in the mustache area, a little blister on the tip of my nose, chills, no desire to eat (maybe because of being stressed thinking about the possible disease), general malaise, swollen groin glands, a little sore throat and all the symptoms of cystitis or urethritis (burning during urination, a little clear discharge, testicular pain, lower back pain. Do you think the symptoms could be from the urinary tract infection or is it a probable case of HIV?

So as per the title, I got a home test kit from [sh.co.uk](https://sh.co.uk/) and sent it back Monday.

She says its quite normal, and that 99% of the time after a retest its all clear and that i'm the 6th person she had called that morning to say the same thing too. I have to go into a clinic tomorrow for a proper blood sample.

After some googling, my understanding of a ""low reactive"" result is that I've basically tested positive for HIV, but that they want another sample to confirm before they tell me :-(

I did have anal in June. I wore a condom, and there was 0 touching before hand, I inserted myself into the other guy and was in there for maybe a minute before stopping. The condom did not break, and I took it off without letting it touch me before washing my hands and then my penis. The guy also said he only does things with condoms, and he had a large supply so believe him.

But I got a test just over 4 weeks after that which was all negative.

Just on here to see if anyones been through anything similar or can reassure me?

Over this weekend I have come down with a very bad sore throat - tonsillitis with exudates, fever and aphthous ulceration of my mouth. I initially took oral abx but my throat worsened and was admitted to hospital. There I was dehydrated and septic and received IV abx and fluids. They didn’t test me for HIV, but my WCC was within normal limits. 
I’m very worried that these symptoms suggest I am immunocompromised and HIV is what I am fearing the most. I have not suffered from an infection like this before. What are the chances I have contracted HIV? Does a normal WCC rule out an acute infection?

When I started having sex couple of years ago I was rly dumb and never used protection (I've slept with 10+ people at this point, mostly no protection,some of it consensual, some not. It was quite messy). Since I cough std (ureaplasma) I got freaked and started being more careful. Anyways, I've been worried about the possibility of catching HIV but I was always so scared to get tested.. Still am. Especially scared of my family and people knowing if I am.. I don't even know enough about it and it's making me anxious for 2 years now, to the point of me having full on panic attacks and spiraling when I start thinking about it. Struggling to get rid of Ureaplasma for quite a long time made me anxious to be touched by people at all and the idea of sex started to freak me the f out. That, combined with unresolved issues with with people makes me so paranoid. I've read some info about the number of young people infected and it seems so big I'm fucking scared. I have no idea how to go about it and not f'ing jump through the window lol. I know the most obvious answer to this problem is for me to get tested and it's the only way I'll stop being paranoid but the idea of waiting for results makes me fucking panic. Is a possibility of catching HIV big? I fucking hope I didn't fuck it up that bad.. Anyways I have no idea why I wrote all of this, I guess trying to easy my stupid mind...

But to answer the original question in the title:\n\nBeing the insertive partner yields little to no risk at 0.11% per protectionless encounter for anal sex and 1.9% for the receiver. If the person was in the acute stage (the most infectious stage - aka the first 12ish weeks after infection) you could multiply that by 7.25.\n\nTo put it into perspective, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a condom into the equation, and this % goes down to almost zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)\n\n**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER studies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext).)\n\nSo to answer your question, no - it’s really not easy to become infected with HIV even when you come into contact with the virus. It’s a weak virus that needs a perfect lineup of things in order to infect. Hit up [The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) for more info on transmission.\n\nThe reason HIV spreads is because people who do not know their status and aren’t responsible with regular testing spread it unknowingly.

The idea is that people could come up and talk to the people at the table, and wouldn't know the difference between the hiv+ person and the other people there. We would collectively educate people about hiv stigma, what it means to be undetectable and on treatment (with regard to transmissibility), and generally promoting safe practices and informed decision making to help reduce the stigma.

Both before and after we are done talking to the people, we would ask them which person they think is HIV+ (the idea being that they won't know because there's nothing different about that person).

2 weeks before I had my wedding I wanted to cross off a fantasy I had for years. I met with a bi sexual married escort couple that provided 3some services to bi and straight guys. They even provided bareback (unprotected) service. I decided to do this high and drunk and made a stupid decision and agreed to have an unprotected straight 3some with them. We engaged in all sorts of penetration and oral acts you can think of: DP, DVP, anal sex, giving/receiving oral. At some point during our session the guy even asked if I wanted to do DAP (double anal penetration). I nicely decline because I knew there was a high risk of exchanging blood with that act. After it was over, I honestly have to say it was the most erotic thing I have ever done.

Fast forward to 1 week after my wedding, I found sores or pimple like symptoms growing on my tonsils. I freaked out and went to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me with strep throat and prescribed me some antibiotics. The strep went away and came back after a week, I went back to my doctor and he prescribed me with some stronger antibiotics. The strep throat went away and I never felt anything weird or suspected of being infected with anything.

Fast forward again to today 9-20-13. My wife calls me and said she had to leave work due to a really bad fever, body aches, headaches.. etc. She went to the doctor and the doctor said she had a 101 degree fever and has some sort of infection because the back of her throat was bright red. The doctor gave her antibiotics and sent her home. I then started to think.. maybe I got infected with HIV from that escort couple and gave it to my wife??!!. I started to freak the F out at work because about 5 days ago my wife and I had sex while she was on her period, I thought maybe I passed something through her blood. So I decided to pick up the OraQuick HIV test, locked myself in my office and took the test. I waited for the longest 20mins of my life. When I check the test results, it came out negative. I have never been so relieved in my life.

I just wanted to share my story with y'all here because this is something I can't tell anyone I personally know and I just really need to let it out. Its my dark secret and I am planning to take it to the grave with me.

I was dealing with this fine, as I thought I would be able to go to Planned Parenthood this morning and get tested, but they don't do testing on the weekends. The only place that I can find that might is the Hospital, and they won't release your results for two days so they can get a confirmatory diagnosis. On top of that, they charge a bunch for emergency care fees.
I haven't been tested in about a year, but I keep freaking out that somehow I was the one who gave it to him. If he's being truthful about not sleeping with anyone else, the timeline just makes sense (it takes about 3 months from the point of infection to tell). I know the chances of transmission are low from bottom to top, especially with a condom, but I can't find anything definitive online. One of my friends got drunk with my last night in an attempt to calm me down until this morning, but now I don't think I'll be able to get tested until monday/tuesday, and I have no idea how to wait that long. I live in SWVA if anyone knows of any testing centers on weekends.
Can anyone tell me what to do, or help me out here. Any statistics that might give me more information? I'm terrified right now.",2012-06-23 22:07:16+00:00,['[removed]'],164

I used to teach sex Ed, I know hiv isn’t a death sentence, I know it’s completely manageable, i know undetectable= untransmitable. But the social stigma is terrifying, the thought of how it would impact my life is scary. 

I immediately called a friend for support, found a rapid home testing kit and took it. The results said negative. This morning I went and had my blood taken bc I know rapid tests can’t be 100% accurate, but it’s a Friday so it’ll be mid next week before I get my results. 

I’ve only had two sexual partners this year, unfortunately didn’t wear a condom with either. One of them was based in another city in my state (same city that the health department’s zip was from) so I’m thinking it was him, but very easily it could not be. If it is him, he didn’t cum inside me. In the end it doesn’t matter, I don’t blame whoever gave it to me and I don’t resent them. I made the decision to not use condoms just as much as they. Also it could be a partner from any time of my life, doesn’t have to be a recent partner. But 2 years ago I moved states and the health department called from my current state which makes me think it’s more recent, which is relieving. I called my primary care doctor and told them of the exposure, rapid test and how I’m waiting on the blood work. I asked if I should take any medication currently even tho I could’ve been exposed a long time ago. Waiting for a call back. 



If I’m being honest, I am REALLY freaking out. I keep imagining how this will impact my future relationships and life and expenses. I’m trying to accept that this might just be my life so that I’m more prepared for the positive, but I’m so afraid. I’m scared I’ll never find a relationship. I’m scared doctors will treat me different. Im scared of the financial impact. I’m scared to disclose to close people in my life. I have paper thin skin and bleed easily and I’m scared for the people around me. 

I know I don’t know the results yet, I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone else in my life yet, and I just needed to let it out in a safe place. I hope I have not offended anyone, I know this is manageable. I just need a safe place to share my fears and feelings.",2021-11-05 18:15:01+00:00,"['Ahhh I feel so much for you.

The stigma is of course the real factor here - but times are changing. People are much more clued up on U=U, PrEP, PEP, that hiv isn’t a life sentence (far from it, in a lot of developed countries poz ppl have higher life expectancies than neg)! And there will be a cure within the next 5 years - I’m quite sure of it!\n\nIn terms of dating etc - if you get bad news (and maybe in the meantime to ease your worries) you should watch Jennifer Vaughan videos on YouTube.

I’ve had pretty much all acute HIV Symptoms still testing negative after exposure.

I had insertive anal sex where condom may have broke with a trans lady.

I have tested at 4 weeks, 7 weeks and 10 weeks all negative and with home sampling. Which I believe would be 3rd gen using a finger prick. And then another at 80 days 3rd gen which was blood drawn from vein.

I have even had an antigen and antibody test at 65 days also negative.


I have had a fever for 2 months, I had very painful neck lymph nodes. Have a burning sensation in forearms. I have persistent diarrhea and oral thrush. Tinnitus. bruising easily and way more. Fatigue. Muscle Aches. Just general discomfort and feeling of burning on my arms. Droopy eyes. Headaches

90 days on I am still feeling extremely unwell. Nothing psychosomatic. Whole body has felt like it’s burning.

I’ve never physically felt like this before and I know the odds are low given the tests I’ve done but it seems highly unlikely I pick up a rare condition off the back of my exposure that mirrors HIV for the first time.

Your support would be greatly appreciated thanks. 😊,2021-10-26 04:18:20+00:00,"['I took PEP about a year ago after I had unprotected sex with a guy I had been talking to online. It wasn’t my intention to have sex without protection but in the moment I did what I did. Needless to say, I regretted it and subsequently went to urgent care to be screened for stds and get on PEP. I was given a prescription and was on it I’d say maybe 4-5 hours after potential exposure. While I was happy to have acted preemptively, that optimism quickly faded as I began to feel symptoms related to the medication. I felt very nauseous and lethargic. Most days I was exhausted and just wanted to lay in bed. The nauseousness was really difficult to deal with and the constant stomach aches made the experience uncomfortable. Overall though I would do it all over again (taking PEP, not having bareback sex). It was an eye opening experience and though I had considered taking PrEP, this experience made me feel like it wasn’t for me. I would endeavor to be safer and more selective about my sexual exploits. Thankfully, I’ve stuck to that.\n\nIf you’re asking because you’re considering taking it, I would say to do it. It may be unpleasant for the next month but it won’t be anything that will severely impact your ability to function day to day. Not to mention the fact that it can significantly reduce the chance of seroconversion. Also, time in this case truly is of the greatest importance. The closer to potential exposure that PEP is taken, the higher the chance that it will help potential conversion if you have in fact been exposed to HIV.']",210

220,Does this sound like HIV?,1,qc0uas,HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qc0uas/does_this_sound_like_hiv/,2," 

Already waiting results on a test but I’ve been an anxious mess for a few days now. To the point where I’m thinking every little thing that could be associated with the anxiety I’m thinking is associated with HIV...which is making everything worse...

32/m - This past weekend I randomly saw a small amount of discharge down there. Now this was weird because I haven’t been sexually active in months (last time was the first week of September). And all of my partners have been known HIV negative for years (people I very much trust and have known for years, not just randoms). I did an oraquick test but it was a defective test. Since I needed to be seen for the discharge anyways, I figured I’d just get a work up done while I was there.

Combine this with the fact that I just got over a bout of potential COVID in August, followed by an a cold the past week/week and a half, and now I’m freaking out thinking I’ve had this for years and never known. And I mean YEARS. Potentially up to 6+ years.

I never got tested because I rarely put myself in “risky” situations. I’m not saying I was perfect, and I know I SHOULD have been tested much sooner, but I’ve only engaged in sex with another male twice, both times fully protected, and every other time has been with a female, mostly women I knew were not HIV-positive

I did engage in unprotected sex with random females during my college years, but they assured me they were STD free, and it wasn’t often (I can only think of maybe 4 encounters total?). Statistically speaking, I realize it would have been very, very difficult to even encounter a woman with HIV to begin with, much less contract it from her.

I did have some kind of NGU back then as well, which was treated by antibiotics and cleared within a couple days. The doc I saw back then wasn’t super concerned about many STD’s given the information I gave, but obviously gave me some information on gon and chlamydia, did a culture that turned up positive for an infection, gave me some antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

However, I’m not seeing much progress this time around from the antibiotics I was given. It’s only been a couple days, and I see that it could sometimes take up to a week or more, but it’s still unsettling to me. 

None of the trusted partners I had in the past 6+ years have contacted me about contracting any STD at all, much less HIV, so I believe that also might be a point in my favor but, also, just never know.

The clinic I went to this time recommended a full std work up, which from what he told and I understand is common practice, he did a physical examination of my hands and feet, no abnormalities, once again gave me antibiotics, and then sent me on my way. Said they’d call me within 4-6 days with results.

Since my last sexual encounter, I’ve had covid and a cold, both of which have subsided. Some other symptoms I’m experiencing now:

\-loose stools (could be from anxiety)

\-dry cough/coughing up phlegm (also just getting over a cold, also I have allergies)

\-occasional shortness of breath (also probably from anxiety)

\-“rash” on my face (I have dry skin on/around my nose, have had it for years, and I didn’t keep up with lotion/washing my face over the weekend so it’s noticeable at the moment)

\-loss of appetite, but I’m still eating normal proportions (also could be anxiety related, and because I’m still eating without the appetitie, could be contributing to loose stools)

I have not been feverish, have not had much fatigue (other than maybe from lack of sleep with all this keeping me awake), no swollen nodes, not losing weight, no random sores, just in general not “sick” at the moment from what I can tell.

The only other cause for the discharge I can think of is I happen to have a resistant strain of an NGU bacteria like MG, and so it just now decided to present itself over the weekend. Would also explain the lack of progress on treatment.

I’m also thinking that if this was some kind of late stage HIV, that I wouldn’t be getting over two completely separate sicknesses in relatively normal timeframes.

I guess another question I have (if you’ve made it this far lol) is if anyone has had experience with recurring NGU, and what that experience was like.

If you made it down here to the end, thank you.

So had unprotected sex with a random girl. Later i found out that she was a sex worker fml. 15 days later had rashes on my feet, hands, arms and my penis(non itchy red blothes). Severe fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, stiff neck, white tongue, loss of appetite, nausea etc. tested at 1,4,8,13 weeks by elisa 4th gen hiv combo. Got a HIV PCR test at 15 weeks but still negative(my underarms were very swollen at that time) Did HIV Elisa at 6months still negative. Still have rashes on my penis and some spots on hand and feet which comes and go. Tried every antibiotic and OTC meds but nothing worked. Also have swollen lymph nodes, fatigue. Its been more than 6 month now nothing is showing up in tests.
Is it possible that tests show true results until lymph nodes burst.
Can my viral load be naturally suppressd?
Also i tested for herpes and syphillis both tests came back negative.
My doc said your HIV test is conclusive and you dont need any tests.

Can anyone tell what is happening?

I got threatened with getting killed by my father at least 4 times and he almost did it and I ended up pretty much with a ptsd. I thought I was losing my mind, had bouts of depersonalization and derealization.

After a month of dealing with these issues I was with a friend and we had sex with a third person (he suggested we do it so I can have 'fun' and forget about my issues, haven't really had sex for a long time). I wore a condom the entire time, except took it off briefly after the first oral (before any penetration) and stupidly used the same condom again after. As far is I could see the condom did not burst and my cum was still in it after I removed it after sex. It all feels like a blurry dream since I was in such a bad mental state.

I got freaked out because we met the third person for the first time, so I did not know their background. When I asked if they had HIV through messages later they said no, but I also know they have a lot of unprotected sex.

I was put on pep a day later, but after 3 days when I went to the HIV centrum they told me the risk was so low that I should stop taking pep. About 5 days later I developed a rash on my inner thighs which looked like infected hair follicles. I was given an ointment by the doctor which helped it go away for the most part.

About 7 days later I started getting a small sore in my mouth that healed after 3 days followed by another sore. I also developed diarrhea. At the same time I also started noticing small rashes here and there that come and go within like 30 minutes up to 2 hours. They are very mild and disappear after a little while. I also experienced burning on my chest at night and acid reflux.

I've not had a fever or swollen lymph nodes, no tonsilitis, a little weakness but I had it prior to this as well (chronic).

I'm really not in a good state of mind. It doesn't help my mother noticed I've been going to the doctor more often and to hurt me she said ""I hope you come down with an illness so bad that all you can do is be fully dependant on me like a dog and you cry about it until you die"".

I had a test the first day after sex and I was HIV negative, I'm waiting for the 6 week mark. I went to 2 different doctors who didn't think much of the rashes and both said if it was serious it would be body wide and not go away so fast. As for the diarrhea they think it is something else causing it. I told them I was scared of HIV but they said my symptoms were unusual and they didn't really suspect that. I am awaiting a stool and urine sample result right now and waiting about 3 more weeks so I can get tested for HIV again.

(By high risk I mean actually coming into contact with the virus) HIV is a weak virus and ironically needs a perfect line up of things for it to successfully infect a new host.\n\nThe three main things that contribute to infection are:\n1. A present - and high - viral load (aka amount of the virus in the blood/fluid)\n\nHIV is MOST infectious during the first 12 weeks of infection, It’s said during this stage that infection risk is increased sevenfold (7.25). After this stage, it enters latency and is far less infectious for many years. If the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations.)\n\n2. A cut or wound or access to a mucous membrane on the new persons body (in order to enter the blood stream)\n\nThe chance of becoming infected with HIV when having anal intercourse with someone with unmanaged HIV is 1.9% per act for the receptive partner. The risk for all other sexual acts fall below this. Add a condom into the equation, and this % goes down to almost zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV) \n\n3. A weak immune response to the initial entry of the virus into the blood stream (aka - your body isn’t able to fight off the virus as it enters)\n\nThe likelihood of transmission table on [Aidsmap](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) will show you the exact risk of various interactions.

Either you are relieved and this is a near miss, or you are in the best place to possibly be to take care of your health. \n\nI worked with kids who were born with HIV in Africa, and now some of them have gone on to college.

It's the body's response to the virus, just like it's response to any other virus. 4 months is too long for what you experienced to be ARS. Certainly get tested though.

2. I remember masturbating soon after he came on my hands, a few times.
3. We kissed a few times, but no saliva contact or transfer was involved.
4. A friend gave protected anal sex and unprotected oral to that person, and swallowed his cum. He does not appear to have any cuts or irritated areas inside his mouth, or on his gum.

&#x200B;

My question is, given what we've done, is the HIV+ risk real, or minimal? That friend and I will get tested in a few weeks from now, either way. Just looking for some more opinions...

I'm from India and I recently had a sexual encounter with a sex worker (girl). 

We'd multiple sex acts during that night: 3 vaginal intercourse and 1 oral sex(receiver).

First two intercourse happened during the night, and I was completely drunk so during the second time I didn't had ejaculation. She loosened the condom a bit to reduce the friction (what is the possible exposure?) . We left as it is and went to sleep. 

PS: All the vaginal intercourse were protected expect that intentional condom loose and the oral sex was unprotected.

I did in fact have unprotected anal sex (he did not ejaculate inside of me any time) with him ~3 times (drunk every time. nice job me!) and swallowed his semen probably about 10-15 times. The only reason I did this other than being drunk was that he's had HIV for 11 years and has been completely undetectable for 6. I have read that the risk involved with someone who has been undetectable for a long time is close to nothing even with unprotected sex.

So we broke up about a month and a half ago and I bought an ORAQUICK test off of Amazon. The packet said that there is an increased chance of inaccuracy unless you wait 3 months. I thought screw it I need some kind of peace of mind and took the test.

Negative. Whew. Relief. Still though, should I still be concerned over my status? Am I being overly paranoid or should I go get a legitimate blood test? I don't want to be irresponsible but I feel like the chances are soooo low that it may be over kill.

Dear Reddit,
My brother and his wife are currently in the process of adopting a little boy from Uganda. They've been going through this process for a few years.
Here's a little back story.
A year ago, my brother and his wife realized how ridiculously comfortable their lives were. They felt convicted about this and decided to try to share their comfort with children who have literally nothing. They raised money and went to see orphans, both abandoned and parent less, in Uganda. Whilst in Uganda they met a little boy named Paul, who was HIV positive between 6 and 8 years old, who weighed around 30 lbs if I remember correctly. He stole their hearts.
They worked with people there to get him moved to a better orphanage, and started the process of adopting him. 
Sadly, the laws there prevented them from being the right family for them. Their hearts were broken, but they weren't ready to stop trying.
Some friends of theirs new of another little boy in need of a family, also HIV positive, in Uganda, available for adoption. They enthusiastically pursued this. 
Back to present day. The type of adoption is different, initially they were doing a private adoption, but for Levi, it had to be through the agencies. Meaning more expensive and much more fast paced, due to his condition and age.
Basically, what I'm asking is if you feel so called, help them out with 1$ and maybe if we get enough 1$ donations, they can meet their goal.
They need I $14,000 by September to be able to go and get their new son.
Also, wanted to include that HIV+ babies have a much harder time getting adopted even though the condition is completely manageable. 
here is a [link](http://www.projecthopeful.org/waiting-kids/matched-children-and-families#Levi) to donate tax deductible. The link provides more details.
My husband and I are both posting this for more exposure.


TLDR: My brother is trying to adopt from Uganda, Adoption is expensive. Looking to reddit to help out.
