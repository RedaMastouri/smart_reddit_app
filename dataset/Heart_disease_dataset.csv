2,My diagnosis of Cardiomyopathy,12,a08o1k,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/a08o1k/my_diagnosis_of_cardiomyopathy/,3,"Six months ago I was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy after an Echo revealed i had an ejection fraction of 25%. I am 28, was the weekend binge drinking type, and I smoked at the time. The only symptom I had, which led me to the doctor, was heart palpitations after smoking. This news was such a shock it took some time to really come to terms with the diagnosis. I was put on your standard medications for heart failure, and scheduled a heart cath. As I'm sure many here know, a heart cath isn't a very fun procedure but i got my first bit of good news. My EF had improved to 40-45% during the short period I was on the medication, no blockages were detected so the cause is idiopathic. The doctor wanted to wait 6 more months of being on the medication before performing another echo. I already have significant anxiety issues, but this amplified it to the nth degree, so this period of 6th months was the most trying time of my life. I finally went to the cardiologist last Wednesday for my follow up, and more good news, my EF is now 50-55% within normal range. Again it has taken some time to digest this information. To go from believing you may only have 2 years to live, to getting your life back is pretty profound. I know there are many here that do not have a chance of healing the issues they have, but I am writing this to anyone with a new diagnosis who is looking for any positivity to grasp onto, as I was when I first received my diagnosis.

The most recent one seems to be with my heart, which is now out of wack after I had vyvanse and smoked alot of weed the same day i took the vyvanse.
Ever since then, i get heart palpitations everyday. I went to the cardiologist and he said I have mitral valve prolapse from an echo but that I should not be concerned about that.
A month after the heart incident, I try light jogging in place. 5 minutes in the jogging I grew very faint and I can feel a werid vibration in my heart beat while and after the jogging.
My diastolic pressure dropped to 56 after those 5 minutes.
I used to be able to jog a mile under 14 minutes. Now I cant even stand a few minutes of light jogging in place.

Not only do I have a heart issue but I also have digestive issues (now suspected autoimmune hepatitis) and sjogrens syndrome. Im sick in so many organ systems and I am losing hope.

I could handle all that, but not my new heart issues on top of it.
Its too much. I can't even fucking exercise to lose weight (I'm overweight) to improve my supposed hepatitis.

I am meeting with my cardiologist tomorrow to discuss the results of a holter monitor.... I wonder if I can benefit from an ablation, should I have arrythmia (It really feels like I do).

I do not want to just live with this, I want to treat this and get better. If anybody has experience with arrhythmia and treating it, please share it with me.

So I do not know exactly where to start, this whole process seems to me like an XXL episode of Dr. House with no end. So it all started with a head pressure about 3 weeks ago, I dont know exactly how to describe this I would not say that its a headache, much more like air is building up in my brain and pressing against the back of my head especially when sitting or walking, this led to small panic attacks in the beginning because I had the feeling of losing consciousness (i never had panic oder anxiety attacks before), I went to the doctor several times and he said it was only stress, it passed a week and then i had the worst panic attack with head pressure, tingling and dizziness, I measure the blood pressure several times and I was shocked 230/130 so I immediately called the emergency and they measured again and it was 196/120, they took me to the hospital, blood was taken and my blood pressure has calmed down without medication to 155/88 and I was discharged from the hospital the same evening (which has surprised me after this blood pressure) the next day i was desperate and went to another doctor, he did an ECG and a 24-hour blood pressure measurement and determined that the blood pressure is too high for a longer period of time now, amazing doctor immediately called the hospital and arranged that I get examined, arrived at the hospital I got an X-ray of the lungs and an Ultrasound of the heart and the kidneys. they took a lot of blood and an urine sample, a 24-hour ECG and another 24 hours blood pressure measurement Later, I'm not really better, sudden extreme heart palpitations, shortness of breath, head pressure and strange muscle twitching everywhere on the body. they told me my results were okay and discharged me from the hospital, since I was discharged 5 days have passed,I take 2 blood pressure pills daily (Amlodipine 5 mg, Ramipril 2.5 mg) and it is unfortunately hardly better, I have an extreme walking imbalance, dizziness and it is difficult for me to walk a straight line, sudden heart palpitations which do not stop, shortness of breath and the mentioned head pressure. 2 days ago I had an MRT of the kidneys. Out of desperation I went to a private clinic yesterday and had an ultrasound of my carotid arteries and an MRT of my head done, everything was fine but the doctor there also measured my blood pressure and it was 185/103. The doctor looked at my blood samples from the hospital and said I could have a pheochromocytoma (tumor in the adrenal glands) and recommended that I see an endocrinologist to check this. This is going to sound weird but I was almost relieved that there could be a cause for all of this. So today I Called the secretary where I had my kidney MRT done and she tells me there was nothing too unusual, now I am at maximum despair and really dont know what to do now . I'm sorry if this whole text is a bit of a mess but that reflects my current thoughts quite well, I don't want to steal your time but I hope someone can help me or has a guess as to what all this could be, Thank you so so much in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this .

16,Understanding the Differences Between the Most Common Forms of Heart Disease,8,d5pnfk,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/d5pnfk/understanding_the_differences_between_the_most/,3,"When we talk about heart disease, it's important to note that all forms of heart disease are the same nor do they necessarily emanate from the same root source.

Most of us who have heart disease today were not born with it. Instead, it is something that developed over time. Adult heart diseases are usually caused by hereditary factors, lifestyle factors, or a combination of the two. When most people think of heart disease, they picture the typical heart attack as it is portrayed on TV and in the movies. The victim gasps, clutches their chest and collapses. However, heart attacks are not really heart disease in and of themselves - rather, they are the result of heart disease that has gone untreated until it was too late. 

I put together this list and description of the most common forms of heart diseases in adults to help clarify between them all.

Coronary Artery Disease - This is the single most common form of heart disease in adults today, and also the main cause of heart attacks. Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries, the arteries that feed blood to the heart, are blocked or obstructed. Remember, no other muscle in your body works as hard as your heart does, or has such a crucial job. Because the heart is so busy, it needs more blood and oxygen to function than the other muscles in your body do. If that blood flow is cut off, the heart can’t pump like it should and starts to die.

Peripheral Artery Disease - Peripheral artery disease occurs when arteries other than the coronary arteries are blocked. For example, an artery in the leg might narrow and become blocked or obstructed. This can also cause a heart attack or a stroke.

Valvular Heart Disease - Not all heart valve problems are congenital. Some people are born with heart valve defects, but in many other people, problems in the heart valves develop over time. This can occur when the valves become hardened, or calcified, as a result of old age. It can also be a result of rheumatic fever or other types of heart disease. Valvular heart disease occurs when a valve becomes either stenotic(narrowed) or leaky. Both types can weaken the heart and cause it to fail if they are left untreated. Valvular heart disease sometimes produces no symptoms other than a heart murmur.

Cardiomyopathy - Cardiomyopathy is a doctor’s way of saying that your heart muscle is getting weaker. This can occur as a result of other heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease. Also, it may be caused by illnesses in other bodily systems. For example, kidney failure can cause it. There are two types of cardiomyopathy: dilated and hypertrophic. Dilated cardiomyopathy happens when the muscle in the heart becomes enlarged or dilated. When heart muscle enlarges it also becomes more flaccid and can’t contract with as much force as it should. On the other hand, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes too thick and stiff, and can’t pump enough blood to keep up with the body’s needs. This type of cardiomyopathy is usually caused by genetics.

Cardiac Arrhythmias - Cardiac arrhythmias are disturbances in the rhythm of your heart. Each side of your heart is told when and how fast to pump by an electrical impulse. These impulses originate in the sinus node and are communicated throughout the heart via electrical pathways that function like invisible wires. If anything happens to the sinus node or disrupts the flow of electricity through the wires, arrhythmia can result. There are two different kinds of arrhythmia. When the heart beats too slowly, doctors refer to it as bradycardia. When the heart beats too quickly, it is called tachycardia. Arrhythmias can either be mild and self-correcting, or serious enough to kill.

Pericarditis - A thin lining of tissue known as the pericardium encircles your heart and protects it. However, sometimes this protective sac can become inflamed, a condition called pericarditis. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and sometimes complications if the inflammation is severe or does not resolve itself quickly.

Heart Failure - Contrary to what you might think, heart failure does not mean that the heart stops beating. However, it means that the heart is no longer able to pump blood with as much power as it should be able to. Therefore, none of your organs are getting as much blood as they need, and waste products are also not being removed as fast as they should be. At least 5 million Americans live with a diagnosis of heart failure, including me.

Coronary Artery Spasm - In this disorder, the coronary artery experiences an involuntary contraction or spasm. This can interfere with blood flow to the heart, potentially causing a heart attack. Medical scientists are not yet sure why this happens. It does not appear to be connected to narrowed or hardened arteries or into other forms of heart disease. Drug treatment is available.

From this list of the most common forms of heart disease, it's easy to see why heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women worldwide, but by being proactive in living a healthy lifestyle and working with your doctor it is possible to manage, prevent and reverse many of these conditions.

18,Severe Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation.,8,onpkm7,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/onpkm7/severe_tricuspid_valve_regurgitation/,5,"Hi everyone. 

A quick question that maybe can ease my mind a bit.  Firstly, I have already a pig valve for my tricuspid valve and I'm about 5 years into it when I received the news that I have regurgitation and the valve is not functioning as it should. I understand that this means another surgery and have tried my best to accept this. 

My doctor has said to me all the symptoms to me and has asked if I feel any. I'm 26 and very active I'm a professional dancer and I also walk and go on runs when I can. The dancing usually involves around 2-3 hours of aerobic exercise(3-5times a week) where my heart can go up to 160+ bpm. I am not feeling any of the symptoms that my doctor has said or noticing any swelling of my abdomen/feet or pulsing in my neck. (I do get tired after dance but nothing out of the ordinary)

This still doesn't stop me from going into full blown anxiety attacks when I'm alone though. I'm just wondering if it's mainly those symptoms that are the big worry with how severe the situation is? If I'm not feeling it I should just go about my daily routine right? 

Sorry for the long text but this has just been a living hell for me since recieving the news.",2021-07-19 23:06:12+00:00,"['If you want to learn about tricuspid valve disease and heart issues I recommend going on the mayo clinic website and doing research their', ""Ok sorry can't help with that goof luck with the hear valve"", ""\\> noticing any swelling of my abdomen/feet or pulsing in my neck\n\nMeasure.

19,The night before surgery - I have some questions!,9,hicdwa,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/hicdwa/the_night_before_surgery_i_have_some_questions/,14,"Hey guys 

My time is due, I’ll be having open heart surgery within the following month. 27/M biscupid valve repair - if unsuccessful it will be an artificial valve. 
 
I have several questions if you’re all willing to answer.

.Firstly, 
I’m curious what it was like for everyone the night before, was it terrifying, did you lose a lot of sleep, what was going through your mind?
I’m worried I’ll be incredibly anxious, I probably won’t sleep at all, if so what did you do that helped?

And secondly I have a few random questions that often swirl in my mind.

.Was recovery better or worse than anticipated? Was it incredibly painful afterwards or was you like “hmm this is bearable with medication” i’ve heard mixed things. 

.How did it impact you mentally?
Something I’ve heard and read is people being in very low, or nasty moods. it’s probably an individualistic question, but I’d like to hear the answers. 

.Do you feel like your life changed for the better afterwards, was it a life altering experience  in regards to personal outlooks on how short life is and how you now spend your time? 
Did it prompt drastic change to lifestyle choices or after a couple months was you back to your old ways?

.A couple years down the line, does it still have a toll, Physically or mentally?

.Do you feel like you can live a normal life, go crazy and let loose occasionally? 

And lastly!

Do you worry about your future with regards to health?


Edit;
These have been so helpful! They’re truly amazing, it’s so hard to find people in the real world that share this experience so this is perfect.

You won't want to sleep horizontally for at least several weeks.\n\nTalk to your family about expectations beforehand and make sure they (especially immediate family) have a support system in place. It will affect them quite a bit to see their son or daughter in such a vulnerable position.\n\nDon't get too hung up on whether you wake up with a tissue or mechanical valve. I went with mechanical bc doctors didnt think a repair would work. One of my constant thoughts in the hospital was, damn I'm glad I dont have to do that again in 10 years.\n\nTry to eat healthy leading up to surgery and exercise if you can. Stronger body will recover faster.\n\nThe night before I wasn't all that anxious, more nervous I would oversleep and miss my 530am appointment.\n\nNo matter your mental/ emotional state now, the medicines can fuck you up,  especially painkillers and steroids. Talk to your caregivers about it and be open about your emotions.\n\nThe pain really sucks but I also was afraid of taking Tokyo many painkillers. Younger patients (I was 29) generally feel more pain."", ""okay, so... my last valve replacement was in 2007 so the details may be a little hazy, but I'll give this a try. I have Tetralogy of Fallot, and when I had my last 'big' surgery, I was 28 years old.   \nThe night before my surgery was weird... I remember not being able to sleep because I was anxious about everything happening the next day. My last surgery prior to that one was when I was 5 years old, so I didn't really remember a lot and I was pretty anxious in the days leading up to my PVR. Honestly, I didn't anticipate being that anxious about things, so I wasn't prepared for it at all. I was with my family and my boyfriend, who were all lovely and supportive but that was it. In hindsight, I'd probably ask to see if any kind of calming meds could have been used, but I didn't even think of it at the time. I was in the hospital for 6 days and then stayed at my parents' house for about a month after that (since they lived closer to the hospital than I did at the time).  \n\n\nRecovery was not so bad for me.... they gave me Dilaudid after surgery (which helped A LOT) but I mostly took it at bedtime. The only things that I remember being really painful were getting in/out of bed (I slept with a wedge under me at about a 45 degree angle for 2-3 weeks) and laughter. (My brother called to cheer me up at one point and I was laughing and crying at the same time because it was so funny (and I was loopy from the pain meds)  and it hurt so bad to laugh.   \n\n\nI don't really remember the surgery impacting me mentally very much.... I think it's just something I've gotten used to over the years. It's just a factor of my life that sometimes needs to be worked around.   \n\n\nAfter surgery (and recovery) was great.... I was pretty sick prior to surgery so having that new valve (and pacemaker for my Sick Sinus Syndrome) was really helpful after working out all the kinks. There are definitely still things that I struggle with.... trying to stick to a low-salt diet and getting in regular exercise. There are some times where I'm really good at sticking to it and others where I just give up for awhile.... I definitely struggle with being motivated to do things sometimes.  (Plus having Sick Sinus doesn't help either, sometimes my arrhythmia is out of control and makes living a 'normal' life hard.... but luckily I've got meds to help me out with that now and it's more or less under control.)  \n\n\nDown the road..... it's hard to say, because you're not sure if the valve will be repaired or replaced, but I've learned to expect the unexpected and try to roll with it. If they offer you to have cardiac rehab after surgery -- DO IT. It was so helpful after I was healed up from my surgery, just getting out of the house a couple of days a week can help immensely.   \n\n\nThese days I more or less live a normal life, I can't work full time (and have been barely working since the pandemic started) but I've got two good dog-walking jobs that get me out of the house a couple hours a week and puts a little cash in my pocket. I don't party like I used to but pre-covid was still able to go out and  have a couple of  drinks with friends.   \nI'm actually a little excited for the future of medical science.... just seeing how far it's progressed even since I was a kid makes me hopeful for the future. I'm hoping that by the next time I need my valve replaced it may be able to be done like a catheterization. I definitely don't look forward to having my sternum cracked open ever again!!   \n\n\nHope this was helpful (and not too wordy!) Feel free to message me if you want =D"", 'I will try to sum up what I can, but I\'m still dealing with a lot of this. Edit: I didn\'t mean for this to be so long but here we go.\n\nI am 30 now, I was 29 when I had surgery (4/12/2019), and everything now is going awesome but it has not been easy. I have Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and had to undergo open heart surgery to remove some excess muscle tissue, to repair the Mitral valve, and a few days later place an S-ICD. I hadn\'t been diagnosed with the condition until a few months before the surgery so it all came at me pretty fast. \n\nNight before: I remember sleeping well, and being pretty calm in general but I did have my doctor prescribe an anti-anxiety med so I\'m guessing that helped quite a bit. I was honestly just relieved that it was time to get it over with, it was the waiting that was hard.\n\nRecovery: Nobody really told me how hard it was, but I don\'t think it\'s possible to explain very well. It was worse than I expected but I had some complications that really sucked. The pain is manageable, you just need to take it really easy and don\'t push yourself the first couple months. One of the harder parts of the hospital stay was my wife staying in the room and taking care of me, and my mom staying in a hotel nearby and also trying to take care of me. We were forced to confront some family dynamics but it was all for the best. I couldn\'t have made it to where I am today without my wife and family. Definitely sign up for a Cardiac Rehab program if possible (although with COVID-19 I\'m not sure if those are even running), that program helped me gain confidence in my heart and myself again.\n\nMentally: I have been all over the place from then til now but generally have stayed positive. I don\'t think I was ever ""nasty"" but you\'d have to ask my wife. I did start a low dose of an antidepressant last fall but will be discontinuing that soon. I have had feelings of low self worth and depression-like symptoms at times when I just felt like I couldn\'t do anything. Today I\'m in a really good place with my fitness and mood, so it took a while but I feel better than ever I think. It all depends on how you view the world and yourself. I am usually pretty optimistic and stubborn so whether I enjoyed it or not I was able to exist through it and end up here. I am definitely a little scarred from the whole thing mentally but I am glad that I experienced it, it was actually pretty cool. I don\'t mean to sound grim, it\'s just something that we all work through differently and that was my experience.\n\nLife changes: All positive. We eat much better, I quit drinking alcohol completely, I am able to exercise and push myself way beyond where I could before surgery. I have never been religious and I\'m still not, but I spend as much time in nature as possible and I do appreciate things in a different way. Almost every day I find myself smiling just thinking it\'s good to be alive, sounds corny but it\'s true. Still going strong on the diet and exercise, I don\'t drink but we will go out for a few drinks with friends and eat out once in a while but I\'m always watching what I\'m eating/drinking. Without support from my wife it would be much more difficult.\n\nI am about 15 months from surgery and I think starting about a month ago this is the first period of time where I feel stable and well. I don\'t believe I still experience any pain related to surgery and have not for several months. I had complications post surgery due to pericarditis or swelling of the heart sac and spent almost 6 months getting that under control. I can live a normal life with some considerations. I cycle regularly, I did a forty mile ride not long ago. I work full time (laid off right now), and I am able to do pretty much anything so I don\'t feel limited. Basically I just don\'t get drunk or eat fatty/salty foods anymore, but there are a lot of things to fill your time and stomach with instead.\n\nLastly, I worry less and less about my future and health as time goes on and I feel better. I have a health savings plan set up with my employer and a retirement plan through them, my wife has a similar set-up. I am just doing what I can now to ensure I can live well, longer. Outlook is good for my condition, and with the surgery I should be able to die a natural death unrelated to my heart someday. I figure technology only gets better, and someday they\'ll give me a new mechanical heart and I can become more of a cyborg!\n\n You got this!']",20

I fucking hate our healthcare system. It’s pathetic. If your not over the age of 60 then they don’t give a flying fuck. Young people ALWAYS get left behind, as you’ll see in this story.

So a friend of mine (21F) who is a tad overweight (but she’s like SUPER tall so no one is too concerned) is very very sick. She’s been ill since we all went out to Mardi Gras together where she had chest pain, shortness of breath &  fatigue. She brushed it off as working too much and not sleeping well so she promised to go to the doctor if the pain didn’t go away within a few days. 

Doctor just brushed it off as a mental heath issue because of her antidepressant medication. STRIKE ONE. 

Fast forward a few months later and she calls me from work saying that she really doesn’t feel good and the pain has gotten worse! I can hear her gasping for air and I told her to hang up the phone and call an ambulance! So she does and goes straight to the main hospital in our area. As per usual, they don’t take her seriously, and stick her out in the waiting room. I arrive with her two housemates in tow a few hours later. In those few hours, she deteriorated further. She can’t stand up, eating or drinking are out of the question and she passes out. On the floor of the emergency department. The nurses who brushed off her chest pain panic. I scream for help and demand them to take her in and admit her. They did just that. 

They ran all the standard tests (EKG, EEG, bloods) but she continues to pass out at random intervals. 

Mid conversation, boom! She’s out.

On the toilet? She’s gone. 

Eating food? She’s passed out. 

I literally couldn’t take it anymore and I demand an ultrasound because there was something seriously wrong and her doctors were chalking it up to mental health. I told her pissy ass little cardiologist registrar to write up a referral and that I would bet my fucking life on finding something wrong with her heart. She was discharged a few days later (still passing out randomly mind you) and the ultrasound was booked. 

Turns out she has a mildly dilated IVC that collapses with provocation. 

She was also diagnosed by a rheumatologist with fibromyalgia. It took 9 months to find out what the fuck was wrong with her. She’s gone from walking around normally, to being wheelchair bound in 6 months.

Whenever you have any mental health issues, it seems like a blemish in your health records and it provides an excuse for doctors to use when they don’t know what’s wrong with you. It’s pathetic. All of us are under 25 and we were begging the doctors to run more tests for her and they wouldn’t listen. It’s left a horrible mark on us and I’ll never go back to any hospital for a long long time.",2019-10-29 23:21:16+00:00,"['I’m really sorry to hear this.

Blood test came back abnormal, but apparently not super abnormal, so they said they’d do another round of blood tests and discharge me. I was like discharge me without a diagnosis?? So again it comes back abnormal and they finally admit they need to do a stress test. Stress test shows coronary blockages and since then I’ve had 2 stents and eventually quadruple bypass.

I am doing much better now, but I can feel your pain and frustration with the healthcare system.

My great grandfather died of a heart attack in his 50s, my grandfather died of a heart attack at age 64, and my dad had quintuple bypass surgery at around age 65.  I’m 40 and haven’t led as healthy a lifestyle as my dad did in his younger years, and I started getting an increasing amount of chest pain in my mid-30s.  This become more significant as time went on so I had a coronary calcium score test around age 37, which confirmed I had moderate heart disease, including some blockage in my LAD artery.  

To be honest, I haven’t changed my lifestyle enough since then to reverse anything.  I’m basically a high-functioning alcoholic, which I believe is the primary cause of my early heart disease and associated symptoms.  I know what I need to do to get better but I have generally procrastinated about changing my life, so things have been getting worse and worse, to the point where I have been having significant shortness of breath and chest tightness nearly all the time over the last 1.5 - 2 years.  I have made some recent efforts to stop drinking and exercise, etc, but they’ve been pretty sporadic. 

Anyway, I started taking French Maritime Pine Bark in January, about 3 months ago.  I started taking it after reading something brief about how it can stabilize endothelial function.  I’ve been taking more than the recommended dose - about 200-400 mg per day.  I have to say, I’m totally astounded at the reduction in my symptoms.  My chest pain and shortness of breath are literally gone, for the first time in years.  I didn’t even notice at first and then one day I was like “hey I don’t have to take deep breaths anymore”.  I’m kinda blown away.  

I did some simple Google searches and it turns out there’s some pretty solid studies that have been done on Pine Bark’s effectiveness at stopping or even reversing atherosclerosis.  

Obviously, I still need to make other improvements to my health, but I thought I would share this in case it can help others.  Link to the article on the medical studies is below.

It’s been about 10-11 years and currently there are no blockages in the area where the bypass was done. \n\nI guess it depends on where they’re taking the vein from — for my dad it was the leg, so now his circulation is really bad in his left leg. The only way to get through it is to slowly build endurance and go on lots of brisk walks (after the surgery my dad would walk for half hour a day, now he either does an hour or jogs for 20 minutes) and lie down once a day — flat on your side— to get the blood flowing to the leg. Swimming is also good too. We actually ended up buying a treadmill so he could also get his cardio in everyday since we live in Canada and it’s hard to go out in the winter.\n\nAnother thing we had for him were pillows in bed  and on all our couches for his leg — if it stays elevated it helps a lot with the circulation too. \n\nIn order to help with the scarring, my dad used to use glysomed cream — it eventually helped the scars fade quite a bit. \n\nSome other things: avoid heavy lifting! This is something he should avoid forever tbh. Sometimes iron levels drop too. So maybe think about an iron supplement and iron rich foods and stuff. Constipation is also a temporary problem after the bypass — Metamucil and lots of water did the trick for this.\n\nThat’s pretty much all I can remember, it happened when I was just a kid so it’s been a long time. I truly hope all goes well — both you and your father are in my thoughts and prayers ❤️', 'I see you posted this awhile back, I hope your father is doing well! I still would like to comment for those who may be searching this thread for similar answers:\n\nImmediately after surgery—I didn’t feel like I went “downhill” until after I had my stomach tubes removed. For some reason that kicked the “omg this really sucks/is hard” recovery time into gear. Just a note to possibly expect your dad to be doing great, but then maybe get a little worse. Recovery definitely isn’t a continuous steady incline in improvement—there’s lots of ups & downs. Additionally, please do expect depression in the months following & take it seriously. If you’re dad is an older “ahh, I’ll be fine” type, have his doctors & nurses really explain it to him before he leaves if possible. It’s mostly just quickly mentioned, all the information they give you when leaving the hospital/what to expect is overwhelming & this bit can be so easily forgotten. Your body can’t recover as well or as fully when it’s depressed, & depression after cardiac intervention is the norm, not the anomaly! Not enough people understand this.\n\n\nNow, for recovery tidbits:\nA RECLINER! After my dads triple bypass, he needed to sleep in it for about a week.\n\nIf his insurance covers it (it’s pricey otherwise)—LIDOCAINE PATCHES. Can’t recommend enough, cut a large one in half so it’s 2 strips, place on either side of the incision/sternum (not on top of the incision of course). Helps with the pain/discomfort & to get off the pain meds.\n\nAlso, on the pain meds: I agree with the user above who stated to keep on top of the pain. Even if he’s feeling great—make sure to take something at a regular schedule. Whenever we (I’ve had 2 open heart surgeries & my brother has had 1, both of us were in our early 20’s, our dad has had multiple including a triple bypass in his 30’s) had pain kick in, it was very difficult to get back on top of it & sent us downhill. Try to substitute the harder pain meds as much as you can but don’t suffer in order to do so. & it’s such a great tip to use the harder stuff wisely, like scheduling it so that they’re kicking in when it’s time to walk!!!!!!\n\n& on the walking, yes, it can be annoying, but getting up & moving is so critical. Go on longer walks each day. (The doctors will talk about this, I’m sure)\n\nA blood pressure cuff was very important and useful. Try to order one that will show up in time to take to a doctors office for an appointment so you can check it’s accuracy vs the ones the doctors use.\n\nLow sodium meals. Get lite salt in the house if you don’t already. Ask any family members who may be cooking to use lite salt & to get in the habit of using it.']",29

But, what is less known is that women suffer from different forms of heart disease than men. Research on female bodies and heart disease is extremely limited. We are learning that women experience different symptoms, have hearts that break down in different ways, which require different tests and need different treatments. We also need a host of new doctors who understand and accept that our hearts respond differently to stress and aging than our male counterparts. 

According to the Center for Disease Control, one in five female deaths in 2017 was attributed to heart disease. Yet, according to a study by the [American Heart Association only a little more than half of women ](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0b013e318287cf2f)are thinking about this killer, a shocking stat given that 50 percent of heart disease deaths are sudden and catastrophic.

The term heart disease can be confusing; it’s a catch-all for many cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, coronary microvascular disease or small vessel disease among others. 

I'm a producer for a women's health podcast, Empowered Health, and while we're working on episodes of all different types of heart disease, we just put out an episode focusing on the small vessels of your ticker. These tiny arterial branches are more likely to be blocked in women’s hearts than men's and because of that, less is known about diagnosing this condition and treating it.  

There are no official guidelines for coronary microvascular disease and women are routinely told incorrectly that their symptoms aren’t related to their hearts. We talked to two experts on the cutting edge of treating and diagnosing women with this condition, so you will leave this episode with a clear understanding of what this condition is, what the symptoms are and when you absolutely must demand testing, and of course how to do that.

We talk to experts cardiologists Dr. Janet Wei of the Barbara Streisand Women’s Heart Center at the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute and Dr. Giulia Sheftel of Newton-Wellesley Hospital to learn more about how these blockages happen and the interplay of estrogen and heart health.

2 years ago the medication stopped working so she went on Imatinib, it kept the cancer away but she developed Diabetes type 2.

Everything was actually going okay, yes she is disabled and needs a wheelchair but we coped and last Wednesday we went to her hospital appointment for a checkup, she even was able to get out of the wheelchair into the car by herself.

Thursday morning she woke up with nausea and acid reflux, we thought she may have picked something up at the hospital, some sort of stomach bug.

No matter what we did it got worse (I had never even heard of Silent heart attacks) this last Tuesday at 4am she went to hospital in an ambulance, (uk classed as a category 2), they did an EKG and it showed abnormalities.

Did blood tests and markers showed up but because of the other issues kidney disease, it was hard to diagnose.

Yesterday she had an echo and it showed her Heart working at 14% (I do not know the exact name for it).

Today they did an Angiogram and it showed two blocked arteries.

Now they want to do an MRI now but its risky because of her issues the Galium (i think that is what it is called) can cause a life threatening skin disease.

27y/o Female 5’5” 140lbs
I have been experiencing chest pain/pressure periodically for a couple years now, which has become more frequent & intense in the last 6 months. (Normally a 2-3 on a scale of 1-10, annoying but not crippling) I went to my primary care Dr. in March and she ran an EKG which showed a slight sinus arrhythmia. She then ran blood tests: (everything was normal) and a 24hr Holter. (A few PVCs & PACs but overall nothing) I was advised to limit caffeine & watch my anxiety. (I take a very mild dose of Celexa for depression) 

By May the pain was not going away despite watching my coffee, attempts at cleaner eating, and relatively low stress work & home environment so I asked for a referral to a cardiologist. Appointment was made for this week. 

Last week though I had relatively strong chest aches, tingling fingers, and headaches for 36hrs straight before my fiancé (he’s a Nurse) more or less bullied me into going to the ER (“May as well run the tests while you’re actively in pain”) 

Triage pulled my BP at 190/90 (I’m historically a perfect 120/80)
EKG was normal 
Blood work was normal
X-ray was normal
ER doctor said nothing emergent and to just talk to the cardiologist at my appointment on Monday. 

Chest pain, numb fingers, achy neck, and headache as well as an average BP of 140/90 continued all weekend. 

Que to today: went to the cardiologist. 
Initial BP was 150/90
EKG was normal 
Chest sounds normal
NP suggests running an echocardiogram and consults the DO. Manually does BP and says is 120/80 despite talking the entire time. 

DO comes in comments on the notes I brought reminding him of him in college, skims them, then tells me that I’m just experiencing PVCs. He said people average 300 a day so my <10 on the holter is nothing to worry about, I’m just noticing them more than most people. They are largely caused by stress or caffeine so I should just manage them “organically”. After listening to 2 places on my chest, he wished me a nice week & left. 

The NP was getting ready to end the appointment by telling me that yes we’d just manage things and if they get worse we can try medicine and asked if I had any questions to which I said, “yeah, what am I supposed to do here?” At which point I (very embarrassingly) started to cry and told her this is ongoing & “managing stress” isn’t a solution. She only then decided to give me what seemed like a pity prescription for a beta blocker & said to come back in 3 months. 

Overall I left feeling very defeated, embarrassed, and unhelped for the second time in leas than a week. Nobody even asked me to actually show where I’m feeling the pain or what all my symptoms were which seems like a basic thing that should have occurred. When I spoke up to better explain I felt as though I was talking to a wall. His description of PVCs is a flutter, whereas my pain is a relatively constant ache with occasional twinges. Plus I have an extensive family history of cardic/vascular issues. (Burst carotid in grandma at 30, both grandfathers had heart attacks & strokes.) 

Not to play Dr. WebMD, but I’ve done a decent amount of reading and keep coming back to Microvascular Disease which is frequently undiagnosed. I feel as though the PVC is an easy bandaid diagnosis with a medication that may help my symptoms (TBD) but that isn’t the real issue. Without a real answer, I don’t feel comfortable with the doctor’s answers: yes exercise is safe, yes I’m healthy enough to try to have kids in the near future, no my type of chest pain doesn’t ever warrant a trip to the ER.

You should have gotten a referral to a cardiologist.  You will probably get a stress test scheduled around that same time, ideally before the meeting with the cardiologist.  If they did not mention this, I would call the cardiologists office and ask specifically if you should do this.  Chest x-rays and ekg's are good a good start, but a stress test is really going to tell the cardiologist a lot.  There are different types of stress tests, but they'll be able to help you out.  In general, I've found the cardiologists' office much better when talking about heart issues than my GP.\n\nThere is *nothing* wrong with coming up with a list of questions ahead of time and working through them on the phone.  When you're talking to the scheduler, they won't be able to answer medical questions, but they should be able to help with process questions.\n\nYou can get through this.  Your blood pressure would be diagnosed as 'mild hypertension'.  While not a good thing, it could also be a lot worse.

I had a heart attack 6 months ago and have had two stents placed. I understand that drinking shouldn't be on my list of priorities right now, but I am only 28 years old and this whole experience has been dreadful.

I wasn't a regular drinker before, I would drink maybe 1-3 days a month, but when I did, I did have a decent amount, maybe 4-8 drinks in a night out (mind you, I was in college just a couple years ago, unfortunately, I graduated college and then had a heart attack). I obviously, don't have to continue to drink to that amount, but I was trying to figure out if there is harm being done in going out 1-2 times a month and having a few (3-4) drinks. I know there is a bleeding risk with my blood thinning medications, but is there anything else I should be worried about.

Well shit.. that don’t help! It makes me feel alone and like I’m against the odds. I haven’t met anyone my age with this defect, they say it usually effects the older generation. Which is another shame because it makes me feel even more isolated. 


The whole situation arose when I went to doctors around 2 years ago due to stomach pains and requiring a belly/chest X-ray, so finding out was an accidental blessing.
The stomach pains went but I was left with a heart condition, a defect I was born with, and never even knew about. 
I was having checkups every 6months so they could regulate my aortic valve to make sure it doesn’t dilate with the extra stress, after 2 check ups they switch it to 3 months to keep a close eye on me as it was starting to dilate a little. 
A little soon turned into a lot and it was at the point they decided to give me surgery. 

So I’m blessed I found out, I don’t think I would have if it wasn’t for my stomach pains. 


They was originally planning on giving me a mechanical valve, but changed to a different surgeon who reckons he can repair my current valve and obviously if failing that they will plant a mechanical one in. 
It’s going to be open heart surgery. 

I have no real idea what to expect, I’ve never been under anaesthetic or experienced anything like this before. 
Any advice, help, reassurance or tips you can give me I will take it all! Please and thank you.

It will go a long way.",2020-03-16 00:00:18+00:00,"['I do not have this condition myself but I have worked in open heart surgery so maybe I can help ease some of your fears. Yes, you are young but there are many others out there who also have to have valves replaced or repaired at a young age. You are not alone. I’m sure it must feel that way. Open heart surgery can seem scary but remember the healthcare professionals who will be taking care of you do this every day. They know their stuff and will work together as a team to take care of you. \n\nI’m sorry to hear you are experiencing panic attacks. I think that is understandable. Have you mentioned this to your Dr? \n\nNot sure if this helps. I’ll be happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability. Either here or feel free to message me.', 'Hi there,\n\nI was born with an ASD and a leaky mitral valve. I had my two OHS at 13 months old and at 23 years old. \n\nI didn’t have any information prior to my second operation in 2018. I wasn’t part of any support groups and I didn’t know anyone that had been in the same situation as mine. I went 22 years between surgeries so I never felt like I needed any support. All the people I knew that had heart surgery were all older people receiving bypass surgeries and stents because of their poor lifestyle choices. Not one person I knew had Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). Which is what we have.\n\nI have felt that same anxiety. It’s a really scary thing to go through and I can’t stand it when older people blab on about how they have it so hard with their own medical problems. Young people deal with this too! Here are some tips I’ve come across that I feel could be useful.\n\n1. Stock up on food and meal prep as much as you can. You won’t be able to use your arms much and you’ll be quite sore for a while. Cooking before the operation will relieve some anxiety after it as well and you will still be able to feed yourself.\n\n2. Get all the housework and errands out of the way. Service your car. Pay your bills. Clean your house. Mow your lawn. Clean your gutters etc.\n\n3. Stock up on movies, video games and streaming services. Entertaining yourself will prevent you from going insane from boredom. \n\n4. Do. Not. Drive. I know it’ll suck but it’s super important that you DO NOT drive for 6 to 8 weeks after your operation. I made the mistake of trying to drive 3 weeks post op and the pain made me pass out at a friend’s NYE gathering. Uber eats will be your best friend if they are around your area.\n\n5. After your operation, go to a cardiac rehabilitation centre for CHD patients. They tend to focus on younger patients like us and there aren’t too many snotty old people making those stupid comments of “you’re too young” and “you don’t look sick”. I got referred to my local hospital’s program and it made me feel like a free for being the only woman and patient under 60. I’ll never go back. \n\n6. Look after yourself emotionally. This operation may turn you into a blubbering mess like it did for me and that’s okay. Talk to someone about it. Post on here. Join a support group on FB. There’s heaps on there. \n\n7. Get yourself a small pillow for your chest and practice getting out of bed without using your arms. You’ll thank yourself for it.\n\n8. I got really sick from the anaesthetic and that’s quite common too. Tell your surgical team that you have NEVER had anaesthetic before so they can balance out your medication. I ended up vomiting for 4 days straight in ICU because those idiots didn’t listen to my surgeon’s instructions. \n\n9. Don’t rush your recovery. It’s a big operation and your body will be slow to get back to normal. I didn’t go back to work for 3 months. I could train for 6 months. I still haven’t gone back to BJJ classes. Take your time and don’t push yourself too quickly. \n\nBest of luck!

82,"Heart Attack at 27 with stent placement, had another stent 4 months later. Still suffering symptoms. Please help.",5,dkce81,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/dkce81/heart_attack_at_27_with_stent_placement_had/,4,"Hi, I'm going to post a lot of information here, and thank you for reading some or all of it. I really don't know where to turn. I'm hoping that I can just detail every part of my situation here and someone may be able to have some familiarity to give me some advice.

I had a heart attack almost 5 months ago at 27 years old. My symptoms were actually fairly mild. I noticed some tightening in my throat when walking and discomfort in my left arm for a couple of days. I did not get any chest pain until a few hours before I decided to go to the hospital and even then it was just a slight burn. At my age, I honestly didn't think I was having a heart attack, but I read the signs and I have a family history of it, so I decided to go to the ER. I even drove myself about an hour to get there. The doctors were ready to send me home with a heartburn diagnosis until the troponin came back and it was indeed a heart attack. They kept me there for two days until they did the angiogram and placed a stent.

Since then, I was in and out of the hospital because I got worried anytime I felt arm pain and stuff. Although, it felt similar to what I felt initially, I eventually chalked it up to just being over-worried and over analyzing the pains. I'm obviously bruising very easily with the blood thinners (effient) I am on, and I concluded that the bruising from that was causing my pain. I have no idea how accurate this is, but it gave me a little (not much) comfort. My cardiologist everytime said he didn't believe what was happening was cardiac, even when I said it felt very similar to my initial heart attack experience.

So about a month and a half to two months ago, I started feeling my throat getting tight again at random times. I can't really say it was exactly like the heart attack experience, because that was a definitive when I start exerting myself that the throat would tighten and then ease up after I relax a bit. This is a little different, it seems to definitely be started by activity, but not really exertion, for instance, I wake up in the morning and don't have it, but I can walk to the bathroom and it starts up, but it will also just remain for sometimes an hour or more. I walk every evening, and sometimes it will be there and go away mid walk, which doesn't really seem typical. It also doesn't really get more intense as more exertion happens it tends to stay at the same intensity. I've seen ENTs and they've checked my throat with both a CT scan and a scope and don't seem to see anything that concerns them from a throat perspective. I also have had my lymph nodes swollen since I've had the heart attack for an unknown reason. My cardiologist kept saying he didn't believe it was cardiac initially.

Three weeks ago it got really bad, and I also had a headache so I decided to go to the hospital, they decided to do another angiogram and I did have another stent placed for another blockage. When looking at my initial medical record, it seems they were well aware that this blockage was there. I am not sure why it wasn't stented the first time in. As scary and traumatic as this all has been I was happy to think I may have some relief now. The same day I went home from the hospital I began experiencing the throat tightness again. I went to see my cardiologist a few days later expecting him to again say he doesn't believe this is cardiac related as he always does, however this time he seemed to be more concerned or at least open to the idea that something is wrong, he is treating it like angina and gave me ranolazine which has been ineffective so far.

I don't know what to do. No one has any answers for me. I've been suffering every single day. I can't focus on anything with these symptoms still happening. My cardiologist just keeps telling me he doesn't believe things are cardiac until I am in the hospital getting stented again and even that hasn't eased my issue. In addition to the throat tightness I often have arm pains as mentioned, and little chest pains and burns. I have attributed this the same as the arm pain as caused by bruising, since I can often find sore to the touch spots on my chest when I feel the pains. Again, I don't know if this is the right way to conclude this, but since my cardiologist doesn't believe it is cardiac and the 6 times I've been to the hospital have been inconclusive, I don't know what else to do. Now the throat tightness, I can't find some kind of reasoning for that. Even the ENTs don't have an answer. So essentially, I go through every single day wondering If i am having another heart attack, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

How many times am I going to spend a weekend in the hospital? I already miss a ton of days of work to go to the cardiologist, ENT, PCP, endocrinologist (I am diabetic), I am also currently having scans done for odd lumps on my breast area (just what I need right now). It's difficult to even focus on anything when I am at work because I always feel as though I should be in the hospital, since I have these symptoms EVERY DAY. I can't hold a conversation with anyone, because I am always thinking about these symptoms. My life has just been suffering. I'm trying so hard to live, but I can't get an answer, I can't get some peace of mind. I can't get anything. I don't know if I'm dying. I go to bed every night wondering if it's my last.

The human body does that all by itself. For pretty much everything else, there's a pill. Or, a machine. For this I've learned. I have survived Guillain-Barre Syndrome twice. I've learned to walk, talk, eat and be as functional as you despite this somewhat heavy physical setback. I've fought off Cancer. I've fought off depression. I've fought to walk on my own two feet, to go to work, to live as fully as I possibly can. The honest truth is that since my first Guillain-Barre Syndrome diagnosis in 2006, I've battled to live.

In November 2017, I underwent surgery: I was fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) - more on this a little later in my story. I've suffered from chest pain since 2007, with some fainting and severe fatigue thrown in for good measure. These symptoms gradually increased to the point in 2016 when I would faint more frequently and with chest pains that caused me to stay home from work. I stopped cycling. I stopped swimming too. I was too tired to manage much more than the very basics of life, let alone a social life or the physical stamina to pursue more work. After a number of weeks and tests in hospitals, I sought help from an electro-cardiologist. I spent a few days in hospital in late October 2017  and underwent an EPS (Electro-Physiology Study). I knew my body’s peripheral nervous system was compromised, that I had about 50 percent strength I once took for granted, and that my heart and brain were always my most sacred of organs. However, that perception was broken. This EPS identified serious heart conditions: along with syncope (fainting), I also have a rare condition called Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, rather standard Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). My heart’s natural functioning, its core abilities, were corrupted: it randomly jumped out of rhythm, it missed beats, it added more beats, my blood pressure randomly dropped or spiked upwards, and it felt laboured no matter if I was resting or walking. My heart stopped a few times; I was brought back to life, thankfully. That alone is enough to scare anybody witless let alone with my daily health challenges. The Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is, unfortunately, a genetic hand-me-down. It is also known as Sudden Death Syndrome. My Guillain-Barre Syndrome m’s complications have now been compounded by my heart conditions, but uncertainty still surrounds this as to the extent of it: basically put, the electrical wiring of my heart has been corrupted, just as with my myelin sheaths/wiring throughout my body. This, unfortunately, isn’t something that can be repaired. It will only further deteriorate - slowly - over the coming years.

There's a pill and a machine for pretty much everything. I've been prescribed a few more pills and I've been fitted with this ICD. The ICD works by pacing the heart (like a pacemaker), but has a built-in 'safety' feature: when my heart fails, it will shock it and thereby resetting it. I can feel my heart sometimes fighting against the ICD, but I can also feel it controlling my heart’s rhythm to keep me safe. Rather amazing.

This isn't a moan. Or, a search for sympathy. This is a Thank You message. I fight daily for survival. I fight to find my freelance clients and then I fight to go to work. I fight to live a productive and happy life. I win most days. On those other days I lean heavily on my support team. Depression is never too far away and slight physical setbacks can push my health and strength back months. My support team keep me sane - well, mostly - and push me to break my own mental chains of ‘ill health’ and ‘limited strength’. We're not sure what the future holds for my health.

That's the perfect time to think about this stuff because knowing you're at higher risk  gives you the biggest advantage in preventing heart disease: time.\n\nMost of cardiology nowadays is focused on treating heart disease once it's already there rather than preventing it, but the CDC estimates 80&#37; of it is preventable with the right knowledge and lifestyle interventions. For that 80&#37;, diet and exercise are certainly key. A low\\-fat plant\\-based vegan diet is the most aggressive dietary intervention for heart disease prevention, which was made popular by Dean Ornish who showed that you can even reverse some heart disease by following it strictly. If you can't realistically follow that diet, avoiding red meat and eating more vegetables without frying anything is a good start. Exercising at least 30 minutes daily also lowers your risk.\n\nThe family history could reflect a genetics basis for some of your risk. While you can't change your genetics, the fact that you know you have an increased risk is super helpful! If you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, treat it aggressively. If after making the lifestyle changes, you still have high BP and cholesterol, don't be afraid of medications. Sometimes they're necessary and I can guarantee you that people who take them to treat risk factors and avoid bigger problems end up taking a lot less medication than those who need to treat a serious health problem.\n\nIf you're in the NY area, there's a new practice focusing on people just like you.

I am approaching this community because I know we've all been directly or indirectly effected by Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

Personally, my father had a heart attack a couple years back, and this was a big scare not only for him, but for all of us that were very close to him. This event ultimately motivated me to combine by deep interest in health psychology with a focus on cardiovascular health.
I feel that each patient has the right to speak up about their treatment process and experience. We all know individuals who have suffered heart attacks and currently going through rehabilitation for their conditions, however, we rarely get to hear about the life-saving and supportive details that accompany their heart disease.
My name is Michael Park, a 3rd year doctoral candidate in Clinical Psychology at Pacific University. I am currently working with Coronary Heart Disease patients to complete my dissertation on the role of familial/social support in their ability to follow treatment in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Furthermore, I am seeking participants who are diagnosed with CHD who are willing to talk about their treatment experience.
The purpose of this study is to identify how social support from family or friends either helps or doesn’t help CHD patients follow their treatment procedures; and why one component of treatment (i.e., diet, exercise, or medication) may be easier to follow than another. The research collected will be used to provide helpful recommendations for family, friends, and caretakers who provide support for CHD patients.

94,Random irregular heartbeats,5,6zdiyo,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/6zdiyo/random_irregular_heartbeats/,1,"Hello, I'm looking for some help. For the past few years I've been experiencing unpredictable, random irregular heartbeats. They can be spaced out by days, weeks, or even months. Sometimes it's benign like my heart just feels like it's fluttering a little between beats (actually feeling like that right now which prompted this post) and sometimes it's terrifying like my heart stops beating for a split second and I feel like I'm going to die (that only happened really bad once, but it's happened a few times that weren't as bad, just scary.) It seems like pregnancy and post pregnancy (breastfeeding if that matters) are when it happens most often, and for some reason at night is more likely. I've had an EKG and a 24 hour halter monitor and both tests found zilch. The next step was supposed to be a two week halter monitor but I was breastfeeding at the time and it was extremely inconvenient. So, I put it off since nothing had been found and it happened so unpredictably, I didn't want to have the hassel of wearing it and it didn't find anything in the end. It got better (meaning it happened less frequently) and I never followed through after I stopped breastfeeding my first. Well now I'm breastfeeding my second child, it's ramping up again, and I'm starting to get worried. 

Other than it being scary, the only symptom is either a fluttery heartbeat or a skipped/paused heartbeat and my fear. I don't get dizzy, get headaches, feel sick, I don't faint, etc.

So now I'm in the same boat in terms of it being an inconvenient time to wear a monitor for two weeks and concerned that with it being so random it'll be pointless to do so, but also I just have this horrible fear that my heart is going to give out suddenly and I'll leave my babies without a mother. I don't know what to do and if my concerns are even founded or if I'm just being silly. 

If it matters I've been experiencing this during my late 20s-early 30s and I'm considered morbidly obese based on the BMI scale, though otherwise I'm extremely healthy (no diabetes, never experienced high blood pressure, etc.)

I had the same fluttering sensation AS WELL AS feeling like my heart would stop for a few seconds and then beat hard like it was trying to get back to normal. It would take my breath away. It ended up giving me major anxiety because I actually had to face the thought of me dying everytime it happened. I never knew if my heart would get back to normal. It was scary and what was even worse was that I had a holter monitor when I was pregnant but they didn\'t find anything, so I just shrugged it all off until I actually had a heart attack 2 years ago. \n\nThey did an echo and found I had an enlarged ventricle (HCM). This is genetic and I have had it forever. Crazy right? So then after that, they put me on meds but I still had these symptoms which upset me that I had this death feeling so often. It was scary for my family too. Anywho, after being on multiple ANNOYING holter monitors, a doctor suggested I get a Lynq implanted. It\'s a monitor that is the size of a battery. It lasts for up to 3 years. No wires or anything.

People dying of heart disease can be a good thing.,5,6o1jda,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/6o1jda/an_unpopular_opinion_people_dying_of_heart/,0,"I am sorry if this post upsets you. I do not mean offense, but I want opinions on this, so I'm hoping some discussing will take place here.

Let me start with saying that premature deaths are a tragedy. I have lost friends and friends have lost family prematurely to heart disease, and I wish it would never happen. Anything we can do to prevent these things, we should do.

I am *not* talking about individuals.

If you lost a loved one, you have my sympathies.

Now, on to the devils advocate portion of my post.

I may use heart attack where I mean Cardiavascular Disease. My apologies.

A few years ago, someone I would have liked to be my friend died of heart disease. It shook me, and caused me to take a good long look at my life. I decided that I needed to make some changes, or I would cause someone else the same pain I was feeling at that instance. So after some trying, I started regular excercise and found a diet that worked for me, and got my weight to a healthy level.

The diet somehow resonated with me. It interested me. I started reading everything I could about dieting, cholesterol and heart disease. It was hard and confusing at times, not having sufficient education to understand some of it, and weeding out the fearmongering and straight out lies and polarization was exceedingly hard.

So a while back, the Dutch heart association was running ads on how women are twice as likely to die from a heart attack, and that was a bad thing. But I wondered. Most heart attacks you hear about are men. So I dug into the numbers. It turns out that women in the Netherlands have *far* lower chance of having a heart attack. At least, for most ages. Women only have a higher chance of heart attack at ages over 80.

So it dawned on me. Heart attacks are, overwhelmingly, an age related death. People that die from heart attacks are quite often old, and it means they didn't die from something else. Women have more heart attacks because women don't die from something else sooner. So the high heart attack rate is an indication of the fact that we are doing really well in preventing and treating cancers and other diseases.

So, yeah, maybe it would be fantastic if everyone died of heart disease. Because that would mean nobody died of alzheimer, cancer, car accidents or other causes.",2017-07-18 15:38:07+00:00,[],97

I have ADHD and was prescribed Adderall for roughly two years and then seitched to Vyvanse 30 mg for about 3 weeks before shit went down. I was smoking concentrated THC at night. I took my vyvanse around 1 p.m that day and smoked hard around 9 30 p.m.
 2 hours later my blood pressure was rising to an unusual level and this abnormal blood pressure and heart rate gradually increased until 3 hours from the onset of those symptoms. Then gradually, my bp returned to ""normal"" but with left arm pain and heart palpitations.
Yes I have a blood pressure monitor. Yes I monitored my bp every 30 minutes when I started to detect a problem.
The whole episode lasted roughly 6 hours, so my heart and blood pressure were super higher for that duration.
I felt like I had a heart attack. I didn't go to the hospital durig that episode because I was scared of telling my parents I did weed. Well i regret that decision now because I now have exercise intolerance, dizziness, chest pain, and heart palpitations. I canmot exercise like I used to. I cannot lightly jog in place for 5 minutes without experiencing a drop in diastolic blood pressure.
I get a wide pulse pressure whenever I exert myself, like today I had caffeine to see if I still have these heart troubles, and my bp was 122/67.
That's not normal for me.

I went to the cardiologist, did an echo. He found mild tricupsid insufficiency and mitral prolapse and said my heart looked healthy and I shouldn't worry about either defect.

Im scared I may have Pulmonary Hypertension, caused or aggravated by that weed and vyvanse mixture. My heart was racing for 6 hours straight its quite possible this caused scarring or thickening of my pulmonary arteries.
I ain't a doc, but I'm just going by my symptoms. Talking leaves me slight out of breath. My diastolic pressure does not go above 75 and can be as low as 55.

I'm scared of dying. I also have elevated liver enzymes and fluid build up in my abdomen. I am going to the gastro tomorrow to discuss what the next step in investigating my liver issues is going to be.
Im so scared of dying from either cirrhosis or from pulomary hypertnesion or what ever the heck I have.

I'm 20 and I have bad health anxiety due to my dad dying at 41 from coronary heart disease when I was 10, and I also have ADHD. Last year, I had episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath. I also had a high blood pressure during some of these these episodes. One time it was 165/80 after smoking weed along with a heart rate of like 160 sitting still. I also have a BP cuff. Weed can really make your pulse and BP skyrocket, and anxiety isn't a good thing to mix with it. Anyways, once I calmed down it dropped to normal, which for me is like 110/60 ish. I have also had my BP spike at the doctors office and then quickly return to normal once i calmed down a bit.\n\nOne time I actually rushed to the ER because of shortness of breath/chest pain/tightness and a sense of doom. It actually turned out to be basically a panic attack. It was so bad that I fainted in the ER. It was actually quite an extreme case of vasovagal syncope, because of the panic. The EKG I was hooked up to in the ER actually recorded about 15 solid seconds of asystole (flatlined heart), which then resolved without intervention. The ER doc kinda freaked out and sent me to cardiology for a workup where they did troponin, EKG, and an echocardiogram. The med students were pretty interested when they rounded on me LOL! They also did some blood pressure checks in different positions. While in bed it was around 110/63. Standing up made it drop to 100/48, which they said was normal, so I don't think some diastolic's in the 50s are worth worrying too much about, unless you feel faint while standing. Anyways, nothing was wrong, except that I met the EKG criteria for LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy), which I was told was nothing to worry about. Nothing to indicate any ischemia (blockages) or that any of the pain I felt was cardiac. Long story short, I had a major panic attack and fainted all due to non-cardiac chest pain that was totally benign!\n\nMy latest obsession since all the heart stuff is diabetes and obsessively checking my blood glucose (yes I have a meter and prick my finger and no I don't have diagnosed diabetes). I panic at any high reading over 200 mg/dl that isn't normal, even though my doctor said not to worry about it as long as it comes back down and my A1C is fine.\n\nAnyways, my point is that health anxiety can seriously be a bitch, take over your life and give you some serious symptoms! Of course, you should go get physically checked out with a doctor for peace of mind, but some of your behaviors like the obsessive BP checking and research remind me of myself a year ago when I was really struggling with the health anxiety. I have learned that taking a minute and really trying to relax for a few minutes can often make anxiety better, not to mention that stress and anxiety is actually a major risk factor for cardiovascular death, so controlling that is also extremely important, even if it turns out that there is some type of health issue.\n\nSorry for the long reply, I just thought my experience was pretty similar in some ways so I figured maybe it could be helpful!

126,Preparing for heart transplant,3,hj9d84,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/hj9d84/preparing_for_heart_transplant/,7,"Hello all I am a 34 y/o with chronic heart disease specifically Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with Obstruction. Two weeks ago following a heart cath my cardiologist has decided its time for me to have a heart transplant. So I am here seeking advice on how to best prepare myself for a post surgery life. I haven't met with the heart transplant team yet but my anxiety is to great. My biggest concern being how I'm going to be able to support myself financially/remain an equal partner in my relationship with my girlfriend. I spoke with a case manager from my insurance company who was asking if I had questions or concerns about anything. As I've said I hadn't met with any heart transplant people but I did tell her I was concerned about these issues above and she suggested disability and then at one point she suggested I could collect unemployment. I told her I've been working about 20 hours a week and she told me of course you cant be employed and receive these benefits. I said are you telling me its maybe in my best interest to quit my job now? She kinda chuckled and said she couldn't really say that. Having said all that I also interested if anyone has ideas about jobs that would be good for a young post transplant guy like a desk job or work from home skill I could learn. I have no formal education past high school and have worked in restaurants as a server and now manager most my adult life so customer service skills are about my greatest working asset.

Is it in my best interest to quit and file disability now considering it could take 30-90 days? And then how do I bridge the gap in the interim? 

Can you file for unemployment for some heart disease related issue? 

Are there other programs I don't know about?

Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this.

My father (58M) had a heart attack 4 months ago. We caught it in time for him to get a coronary angioplasty. The surgeon mentioned he had heart disease and an impending blockage on the opposite side of the body he operated on.

Last month, he had to get ANOTHER surgery to remove the very blockage the surgeon warned us of. He refuses to change his eating habits. He eats sugary granola, convinced all granolas are healthy. He puts butter on EVERYTHING. For dinner today, he ate a meat pie from Trader Joe's (24g of saturated fat) with a side of white rice WITH margarine on top. And two beers. Whenever my mom and I ask him to be more conscious of his eating habits because we DO have healthier options in the fridge, he gets explosively angry. He also doesn't exercise. I don't know what to do at this point, and honestly, I've given up trying to convince him to change. If getting two heart surgeries isn't a wakeup call, I don't know what else we can do.

My father is someone who hates being told what to do. At this rate, I think he will die from heart disease sooner rather than later. It's difficult having to watch someone slowly kill themselves and be powerless to stop it. I don't think it's too late to change, but that isn't the issue -- it's his attitude. He has no desire to change. When someone doesn't want to change, we can't make them.

At the same time, my heart refuses to give up on him. If anyone has experience with this, I would appreciate any suggestions about other intervention methods we could try.",2020-01-20 03:09:33+00:00,"['First of all, you can\'t force people to change.

We don\'t really have that great of a handle on it (hendlce why it is still the biggest killer in Western civilization, despite all the ""expert opinions"" and ""miracle"" drugs). The most significant cause of heart disease is genetics (so you should be concerned about your own condition as well). Second is smoking. Third is all other lifestyle factors (diet, ,limited activity, random environmental, etc). There is no 1 smoking gun.

As a cardiac nurse, she recognized the symptoms were the same as her patients who described what it felt like to have a heart attack. But she was in denial, how could she– a healthy woman– be having symptoms of a heart attack. Maybe it was her gallbladder or a panic attack? Anything other than a heart attack.

Yet, it turns out she had spontaneous coronary artery disease, which is an under-diagnosed acute heart condition that impacts women much more than men. It is hard to know how many women are impacted by SCAD as it is grossly understudied and understood, but we know that 90 percent of all SCAD episodes happen to women.

SCAD causes tears in the blood vessels of the heart and is typically followed by a heart attack. It usually affects women who don’t have the typical risk factors associated with heart disease.

Many patients, paramedics, and even doctors are unaware of SCAD, leaving them to diagnose heart attack symptoms as less dire ailments, like panic attacks.

We produce a show called [Empowered Health](https://empoweredhealthshow.com/ep-22-whats-happening-to-my-body-the-run-up-to-menopause/), a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode exploring what we know so far about SCAD.

Cardiologists and SCAD experts Dr. Malissa Wood of Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. Sharonne Hayes of the Mayo Clinic teach us about this condition, which causes 40 percent of heart attacks in women under age fifty.

138,Understanding the Different Anti-Hypertensive Medications and Their Side Effects.,5,d6o8td,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/d6o8td/understanding_the_different_antihypertensive/,0,"This is a list of the most common anti-hypertensive medications, how they work and some of their side effects.  This is not meant to be a complete and comprehensive list, just general categories of medications.  Please consult with your pharmacist or doctor for any serious side effects or questions regarding your specific medications.

To understand these medications you should first understand that blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood being pumped by your heart and by the “stretch-ability” of your blood vessels. 
To decrease blood pressure you need to decrease the volume of blood being pumped and/or relax the blood vessels so the opening is larger, therefore, decreasing the resistance to blood flow

Diuretics:  These medications reduce the symptoms of hypertension in two ways.  First, when taken at low doses some diuretics cause the blood vessels to relax.  Secondly, diuretics cause sodium and water loss through urination, this reduces the volume of blood. Some of these drugs may lower your body's supply of an important mineral called potassium. You can prevent potassium loss by eating foods high in potassium, or if your doctor recommends it, you can take a potassium pill along with the diuretic. In people with diabetes, diuretics may increase the blood glucose (sugar) level. Impotence may also occur in a small percentage of people.

Beta-blockers: These medications help reduce blood pressure by decreasing responses to impulses from the central nervous system. This medication both lowers your heart rate (decreasing the volume pumped) and prevents your blood vessels from constricting (getting
smaller). Common side effects are insomnia which can lead to tiredness and/or depression, cold hands, and feet, a slow heartbeat and symptoms of asthma. Impotence may be a problem for some men. Diabetics should monitor their blood glucose levels closely when beginning this medication. 

Calcium channel blockers: These medications affect the movement of calcium into the cells which slows the heart rate and relaxes the blood vessels.  Common side effects are palpitations (feeling your heart beating in your chest), swollen ankles, constipation, headache or dizziness. Side effects with individual calcium channel blockers differ greatly.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: These medications block an enzyme in the body that is part of the substance that causes blood vessels to tighten, therefore causing them to relax. The exact mechanism of action is not known.  Common side effects are skin rashes (these usually go away), loss of taste, and chronic dry, hacking coughs. In rare instances, kidney damage can occur. 


Again this is not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive list of anti-hypertensive medications and their side effects, but rather an overview. Be sure to consult your doctor and pharmacist about these and any other medications.

I am overweight. But my heart problems had happened 5 years ago. Back then I was thinner and was in active in trying to lose weight. I worked out a lot. One night my sister who was sleeping next to me said I was having difficulty breathing while I was sleeping. The next night I woke up with a full blown difficulty in breathing. I went to the ER they did urine test, blood work, EKG and chest x ray everything come up as normal. They told me I was having hyperventilation. 

After the ER episode I went on this horrific spiral of not being able to sleep at all and my heart was beating so hard it felt like its going to leap out of my chest. I have on and off chest pain on my left side of my chest. Abdominal bloating. Heart palpitations. My heart was beating so hard it felt like its going to came out of my chest.

I still have abdominal bloating and I gained weight up until 191 lbs because I was too scared to workout. I am afraid that my heart will give up on me. Even just walking would cause my heart to start beating so hard.

140,Unknown Heart Problem,5,cn0zyj,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/cn0zyj/unknown_heart_problem/,3,"Hello Reddit, I'm completely new here so this makes me a little nervous being my first post, especially on such a serious topic and my heart is already racing. I'm a 33 year old male, 6'1"", and 185 lbs. I was diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia 6 or 7 years ago. I've been in and out of hospitals and doctor offices more times than I can count. My heart is completely weird, I've been trying to understand it for so long and I'm not sure I'm any closer than I started.  I feel that something more sinister is going on with my heart than just IST.

As far as testing I've had 2 to 3 echocardiogram's in my life, Countless EKG's and routine blood work from ER visits. I've worn a 24 hr monitor twice and a 30 day twice as well. Chest x-rays, 1 stress test and 1 tilt table test. The day of my stress test I felt horrible and my heart rate was in the 130's or 140's before we even started and they had to get the okay from the cardiologist just to let me on the treadmill. And during the tilt-table test I pretty much was seconds away from passing out trying my hardest not to (worst feeling ever and within just a few minutes and she stopped the test). Most of these tests have come back as normal or close enough to it. Except for the stress test which I believe has something to do with orthostatic hypertension.

I usually have a resting heart rate of 70-95 BPM, and upon little activity or simply standing and walking around the house a little I can go to anywhere from 100's to 120's sometimes even 130's (mostly asymptomatic). I do get palpitations as well for no apparent cause. I also can get some pretty severe short lasted palpitations (1-3 minutes) from a sudden adrenaline rush (such as playing a competitive PC game), and from anything that makes me nervous or anxious. Bending down to pick things up always messes with my heart too. I'll have to shake my hands and breathe a bit different until my heart returns to normal, thinking I may die or pass out before then.

I also have these more rare episodes, at completely random intervals that may only happen once every 1 to 3 months, during these episodes I awaken out of sleep frantically and confused, heart pounding extremely hard, dizzy, and usually with an arm or one side of the body asleep.. I'll try to make it out of my room and down the hall closer to people in case I'm going to pass out or something and in every one of these situations I feel I am very close but never have. They last 3-10 minutes and I'm completely wiped out after these episodes for a few days walking around like I'm an elderly man.

Although I've been mostly sedentary from these symptoms and problems, I was very active up til 26 years of age.. I've tried working out through the years to get better and healthier since my diagnosis but there are also some issues with that.  I've noticed that I have good heart days and bad heart days, the good days my heart is a bit lower and I feel great and I will sometimes want to take advantage of this and a get a decent exercise in, but maybe I over-exert myself because the same night of my exercise when I'm lying down at night my heartrate will be very abnormally low for me, like anywhere from 48 to 60 bpm while lying there.. If I dose off to sleep, I will jolt right back awake and be shaky and a little lightheaded.. I will not be able to usually sleep at all til it goes away which is not until the sun is out. This can last 1 or 2 nights usually.

I've always been able to go on walks or bike ride and do this kind of stuff with no issues, just not at an extreme pace. But I kind of went sedentary more often, maybe just so I would kind of forget that anything is wrong with me. But over this past month I've had 4 new incidents.. All from walking. My nephew asked me to go on a trail with him at a state park.. It wasn't anything I haven't done before, mild steps up and down, less than a mile. My heart was bad that day, we walked down quite a few steps and then my heart had already hit 160 to 170, I'm in a panic mode at this point and have to wait til I'm calmed down to 130ish, and then we go up a few steps, I'm back to 170, this went on and on until I literally could not recover anymore and had to sit down with 160 HR that was not recovering. I didn't want to be left alone I thought I'd really die there but I had my nephew run for help we had no cell service, scariest moment of my life. Paramedics came and checked my vitals and walked me out after a bit. This happened two more times to a lesser degree while walking my dog and walking out on a trail in town, both also quite scary. I tried even once more by taking it very slow but I panicked immediately went to 140 heart rate and went back to my car,  feeling dizzy and scared. This last time was complete anxiety and I don't think the others were.

I'm also having my calf muscles tighten up and burn/hurt during walks, my entire calves will just feel solid as rock. Resting a bit will make the pain stop and calves will eventually return to normal. Last thing, I get these random swell-ups on my body usually lips, hands, fingers, feet, or wrists, not frequently. Looks like a mild form of angioedema, lasts 1-3 days, itches and burns when touched then returns completely back to normal. Maybe autoimmune related haven't been checked for that yet but plan to soon. If anyone has any idea what is going on with me or has any suggestions on testing to have done, I'd be extremely grateful.

&#x200B;

I'm a 15yo and I think I might have problems with my heart. This might be due to my terrible diet. Whenever my parents leave, I eat junk because I feel like they won't let me when they are home. I know this is terrible and I try to convince myself not to but it doesn't work a lot of the time. I also drink a very minimal amount of water and am never hydrated. Usually my family is pretty healthy- we eat a decent amount of fruits and vegetables with our meals. However when they leave I eat all the bad stuff in our cupboards, chips, candy, you name it. I feel bad about it, and I have decided to stop many times but then the next time they leave I convince myself to just have one bag of chips or Skittles and there we go again. I feel too ashamed to tell my parents, and I don't want them to not let me stay home alone ever again (I enjoy the time to myself).

&#x200B;

Recently I've been feeling pain in my chest and my heart has been going at a really fast rate. I've been to a cardiologist for an issue I had in November, which he believed was mostly caused by stress (I agree, I had a lot going on at that time). I went originally because I had chest pains and my heart was fluttering a little, however it quickly went away. I had to wear a portable EKG for a day, but it didn't pick any of my previous symptoms up. I've been feeling fine... until last month when these symptoms came back.

&#x200B;

It's been more constant than the last time. I also constantly fell woozy, like close to passing out (I never actually have passed out). I also feel a pressure and sometimes pain in my chest, and my heart feels like it's beating twice as fast. Once it started fluttering, but I believe that was due to stress.

&#x200B;

I'm going to try my hardest to stop eating bad, because if I go to the doctor I know that's the first thing he will tell me to do. Then if it doesn't go away I know I have bigger problems. I'm afraid to tell my parents what I've been eating because I think they will be upset. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop eating terrible, or just in general? Should I go see a doctor again?

Something weird happened to me a few weeks ago. I woke up and felt something was not right. My left hand was sleeping and I had weird pressure in the left side of my chest, right under my pec on the left side, but closer towards the armpit.

I woke up my partner and shortly after started shaking like crazy while feeling lightheaded and cold. She called an ambulance which was here within 5 minutes. On the way to the hospital I was already starting to feel better. The pressure was going down, I wasn't shaking anymore and I was starting to get warm again.

I was then in the hospital for about 8 hours doing many different tests and blood samples. Everything came out perfectly fine, in fact I had a very strong heart I was told.

The next day I was experiencing similar pressure in my left side chest and it comes and goes but now without the other symptoms. It is a pressure that often makes me feel like I need to move and turn my chest out of discomfort. No pain, just pressure. It pretty much feels like somebody is constantly pushing my chest.

I should mention I cycle a lot. 4-5 times a week 1-3 hours at a time. Mostly pushing myself quite hard (usually avg 170 bmp). I told this to the doctor as well, but she told me I had nothing to worry about and that I can keep going as hard as I have. I have a resting heart rate of 38, which I also told her, but it didn't concern her again.

I have a slight idea it might be HNPP combined with my heart rate chest strap causing irritation in some nerves around that area, but it really feels like it is inside my chest. 

Should I find another doctor or am I good to go with some discomfort? The doctor I went to was pretty much THE specialist in my country and she also spoke to a couple of neurologists.

1. Get CRP levels and a CAC to determine if I need statins
2. Try to take the lifestyle-change route and exercise more, or take supplements, eliminating basically everything (oil, sugar, alcohol) except vegetables/legumes, then retest cholesterol and CRP levels

183,Could my breathing issues be heart related?,3,pccqsp,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/pccqsp/could_my_breathing_issues_be_heart_related/,4,"Hi everybody.  Just the basics first... I'm a fit 41 year old active female. I do a lot of biking and hiking.  I'm a vegetarian.  Don't smoke, don't drink.  Never had kids.  

For the last 18 months I've had breathing issues.  It's basically painful to breathe.  Sometimes I cough, sometimes I don't.  It started out 18 months ago and it was very mild.  Over 18 months, it has slowly gotten worse and worsen and hasn't let up for a single day.  Sometimes I have tightness in my chest, and pain somewhere between my throat and my chest but it's hard to really focus in on where exactly  the pain is.   I cannot connect my breathing issues to anyone thing.  Doesn't matter what I eat, when I eat, or if I eat.  Doesn't matter where I am.  They start out at a 5 and get worse over the course of the day.  I have a stuffy nose every single night as well.  I realize these don't scream ""heart condition,"" but bear with me.

I've been to several specialist, but haven't had a lot of heart related tests because I don't appear to be somebody who would have heart issues.  I've had a pulmonary function test, which does show very mild obstruction, but was also told that could or could not be asthma.  I was ""diagnosed"" with exercise induced asthma when I was 13 because I said I had trouble breathing with I exercised.  That was pretty much the extent of my diagnosis and they sent me home with a rescue inhaler.  I never had breathing issues outside of exercise once, until 18 months ago. And the inhaler never once helped me during exercise either.  I tried countless times.  I was instructed on using it correctly countless times.  Which was very condescending to suggest that if a drug isn't working it must be user error despite having been shown numerous times and also using a spacer which pretty much eliminates the possibility to use it wrong.

Since I have been to many specialists in the last 1.5 years, I have done different rounds with different inhalers.  None of which have helped.  Some have even made it worse. So either I am totally medication resistant, or asthma isn't the issue!  I have been put onto PPI's as well, and they didn't help either.  I don't have typical heart burn symptoms, but we explored that anyway.

The reason I'm considering a possible heart issue connection is because I have a very slow heart rate.  And because I've always struggled with breathing during exercise that was not helped with inhalers. During the day, while I'm awake and just sitting around, my HR sits around 45bpm.  At night when I'm asleep, it drops to 37-38.  I have always had a slow heart rate, so this isn't new.  I don't know about the sleeping rate as I never measured it until about 8 months ago.  So that could have always been like that, or not.  When I exercise, my HR shoots up to 150 quite quickly and stays at about 155 as an average for a bike ride.  I wouldn't say I'm moving a lot faster than others, but it definitely feels like my HR is 155 to me.  I seem to be having a hard time than everybody else.  Plus I struggle to breathe.  I also have a lot of muscle fatigue for no reason.  Which is odd and new in the last year or so.  I exercise for 1-3 hours 3-4 times a week.  I also have an active job.  So this isn't a case of me just not being physically fit.  I'm just hitting a wall that I can't get beyond and struggling much of the time.

I've had an EKG (showed I had a bradycardia) twice, a chest X-ray (also twice), chest CT, stress test (though I wasn't able to give it my all as I had slept in 24 hours when I had it), pulmonary function test, 24 hour PH monitor, Gastroscopy.... all came back normal.  Allergy skin tests as well.  Which showed nothing.

Could this be hear related?  If so, what tests should I be asking for?  I'm really miserable and things are getting worse.

Prior to that point, she experienced occassional pain but we erroneously believed it was harmless angina (NEVER MAKE SUCH ASSUMPTIONS). On a particularly bad day, we rushed to emergency (1st time) and after an angiogram (etc) it was revealed that she had 100% LAD blockage. She was immediately admitted for surgery. The only available option was a double-bypass. 

She was diagnosed with atypical heart disease (Asian, 45yo, no family history, not obese, and relatively healthy lifestyle, no high bp - in fact, almost leaning towards anemic). :( 

The surgery went well (huge thank you to the surgical team for taking into consideration that she is a young female and appearance matters... meaning the scars are so low that she can almost wear a v-neck. 

**Questions**

The reason for my post is to talk about the medicine she was prescribed. Based on my own research, her prescription is largely based on the research concluded by studying older males with heart disease, obesity, and high bp. Is her post-op medicine really suitable for her? My wife's cardiologist (old school male) won't even discuss the matter, simply dismissing her concerns. 

My primary concerns are if the doses are too aggressive and why is Candesartan prescribed?

&#x200B;

Here is what she takes (daily):

**Morning:**

Candesartan - 8mg (I question this one in particular because it's for lowering bp. My wife has never experienced high blood pressure).

Metoprolol - 12.5mg  (probably important b/c it's a beta-blocker that improves blood flow)

ASA - 81mg (not certain if this is necessary)

**Evening:**

Atorvastatin - 40 mg (probably important - statin - lowers LDL)

Metoprolol - 12.5mg  

Iron (Heme Boost) 232mg - because she is often dangerously low in iron (as diagnosed in blood tests)

I’ve been experiencing a rapid heart rate for the past 4 years, and as of about a year ago my heart rate will have random episodes in which it’s very irregular and unsteady. 
I drink a fair amount of caffeine and live with a very high amount of stress (I have had generalized anxiety for 9 years, and OCD for about the same amount of time.)
When I have the irregular heart rate, I get immense pain in my left arm, and a very bad indigestion-esc stomach ache. The thing is, most of these are also symptoms of a panic attack, and the pain in my arm could be described by attributing it to the hypochondria that accompanied my OCD amidst the pandemic, thus allowing for me to have psychosomatic symptoms. 
There is a family history of heart disease, with my maternal grandmother dying in her early 50s as a result of a heart attack. 
Because of my anxiety and OCD, I worry that I’m having a panic attack that feels like I’m going into AFIB, but in reality I’m just stressed. 
My father is a radio-cardiologist (does heart imaging for hospitals) and told me that one of my episodes was, in fact, AFIB, but I do not know if he was telling the truth or just being facetious.

Saw multiple doctors and did various tests - stress, echo, etc. and all that came back fine. Had PVCs / PACs was told I could get an ablation, but I avoided that. Eventually stopped noticing them so much and was able to get on with life for a bit.

Never got over the anxiety fully, but I try to manage. Well, my dad’s brother passed away suddenly from a heart attack, so I started worrying again. On top of remembering my grandpa had heart problems (He didn’t die from that, but still). Clearly heart issues run in the family and I get truly afraid a lot of times that I am just going to have a heart attack or stroke. Scared to live life because of it and I'm totally going to regret it.

Sorry, back on topic - Wanted to do more to find out about my heart, so around August of 2019 I went to do a CAC scan. Unfortunately, that came back bad and basically told me I had coronary disease. I tried to ignore it, but it has resurfaced and been bothering me a lot as my health anxiety is insane again. Honestly think it is due to work stress, my dad having lung cancer now, along with just me being prone to anxiety and not knowing how to fix it.

Saw my cardiologist today for a follow-up to reassure myself due to my anxiety driving me crazy these last few weeks. Basically, he suggested I take an aspirin daily and a statin. He mentioned this last year, but I shot it down at the time. Says I am the most in shape person he will see all year, but unfortunately, I somehow developed coronary disease. I eat well, I work out, but I totally suck at not worrying and managing stress. Was saying he didn't think more testing would do anything and that is the only thing he could offer me right now.

I attached my CAC score along with most recent lipids, cbc, glucose, and a1c. Figured this would give a better picture of things. I am on TRT due to very low natural levels, but a low dose. I do 1 click of 150mg cream and that is all. Concerned with hematocrit, but my PCP and Urologist say it is nothing to be concerned with yet. Maybe I should give blood though? Seeing that elevated is part of what has me back to being a crazy person paranoid about my health.

Again, just wanting opinions and such from others as it is very hard for me to handle and not drive myself crazy about. I feel like I have read so many mixed things on statins and just with how big pharma is I feel like meds get pushed so easily. Granted my case is obviously different as I try to be as healthy as possible and still wound up with CAD. Appreciate any input you guys/gals can provide.

Rhythm: The underlying rhythm in this report is normal sinus

Maximum heart rate: 193  
Average heart rate: 83  
Ventricular Ectopy: <1%  
Supraventricular Ectopy: <1%  
No pauses were noted  
No atrial fibrilation was detected.   


There were 11 patient triggered events with symptoms of fluttering/racing noted. Three of these correlated with a sinus rhythm. The majority corelate with sinus tachycardia. There is one episode of sinus tachycardia with PACs and PVC. There is one episode of sinus tachycardia with PACs. There are four episodes triggered right after patient noted finishing a 5k at 188bpm. THere are likely sinus tachycardia as an appropriate response to exercise, but at this rate I cannot clear see p waves. There are two other episodes that the patient notes he is running that have significant artifact interfering with interpretation.

I'm diagnosed with panic disorder for about 2 years and it's also about 3 months or so that I sense chest discomfort, bloating and belching which is probably GERD (met a gastroenterologist but he didn't do a thorough examination like endoscopy or something) . I'm currently on 40mg Pantaprozole once a day and feeling 60-70% better but I still sometimes feel GERD pain.

I have no family history of cardiac issues (except an uncle who was obese and heavy smoker, he died at 52 by cardiac arrest I guess, I'm not sure exactly, but it was something cardiac I guess).

He's a 71 year old dairy farmer that's both muscular and flexible, capable of fully extending himself using an exercise wheel, and has no history of health problems.  


That era of perfect health seems to be at an end. He went to the doctor for a routine blood test five days ago, and discussed the results with the doctors today. Everything on the four page list was perfect except for just one small detail: he has severe aortic stenosis. He's going to get aortic valve replacement surgery very soon.  


Reading online, I come across varying life expectancy values. One page says that the life expectancy for 60 year olds with aortic valve replacement surgery is 12 years - a massive decline from the average expectancy of 23. Another page says that the average loss of life expectancy, for all ages, comes out to 1.9 years (4.4 years for those under 50, 0.4 months for those 80 and older). One page says the five year life expectancy post-treatment is 94 percent; another website says 70 percent.  


Aside from the contradictory numbers, one thing genuinely confuses me. If the valve is replaced, and replaced once more if need be if it starts breaking down... shouldn't the remaining lifespan be normal?  What causes this decline in life expectancy, ranging from 0.4 years to 4.4? Is it caused by people not complying with their treatment properly, or not taking blood thinners as they should? Is it due to the replacement valves, whether mechanical or biological, breaking down (and this problem not being caught early enough for whatever reason - whether that be the result of the damage being subtle, or perhaps the patients not coming in for check-ups very frequently)?  


There's also success stories of people getting replacements in the 1980s and still being perfectly fine. What separates these people from the ""12 years and you die"" crowd? Pure luck? Or is this a likely outcome if you comply with your treatment and get your valve checked up on every so often?

The most specific being at his age, a tissue valve should give him at a minimum 10 yrs (that\'s being conservative)  He can then opt for a VIV (valve in valve) - meaning should he need another intervention due to his replacement valve deteriorating, they could thread one peripherally and implant in inside the valve and spare him another surgical procedure.  He\'s at least at the age where that is a fantastic option.  I think the questions he\'s going to have to answer is:\n\nWill he opt for a TAVR, or a SAVR now and hold for a VIV later if needed.  That may be a bigger question.   The unknown currently with TAVR valves is the longevity - the clinical data on that is just not in (meaning good 10-20 yr data).

I am 18 y.o. male and lately I've been really concerned about my heart condition. Two years ago I was underweight and developed some health problems because of that.    
I've been maintaining healthy weight for over a year now and my body seems to be almost fully recovered. However, my average heart rate is about 50 BPM and sometimes it can be as low as 40. At first doctors said that it was due to my thyroid-related problems but now, when my thyroid seems to be fine, my heart rate is still quite low.   
I have some other symptoms as well: constantly cold hands and feet and frequent tiredness. Nothing seems to be too dangerous.  
I also used to do track and field and now I ran every 2-3 days. I was wondering if it is possible I just have strong heart muscle and therefore lower heart rate or there is most likely something wrong?

I have already made an appointment with doctor but I just do not know what to expect and how to feel. I do want to believe that I am young and healthy but I am afraid I am not. Internet is filled with mostly terrifying stuff when it comes to heart disease and it all makes me feel even worse. I just want to calm down and be able to sleep at night again. That's why I will be glad to here from anyone who's been through something similar or has knowledge in this field.

232,My daily recovering and symptoms story( long post),3,gfw3pg,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/gfw3pg/my_daily_recovering_and_symptoms_story_long_post/,4,"I was diagnosed with Cardiopalmus in mid March. I’m 25 male, sharing my story. I would think I’m healthy!  I’m not a English speaker, sorry for the writing.

I believe it happened in March 14,when I heard the big outbreak of Covid-19 to the people I loved. 
The following 3 days, there was always a little pressure around my heart area, but I didn’t pay attention to. I thought it’s was some mental issues, I had some mental issues before. It turned out I was wrong, it was real and a sign of this long weird disease.

March 18. When I was at work at 11am, talking on the phone, suddenly I could not breath. WTF, I tried breathe more air in by my mouth, then I tried to breath by my nose again , felt there was something blocked there, I could only breath 50 percent air in, but when I tried to talk, definitely 0 air. 30 minutes later, I was back to normal. About 3pm, I started get some heat around my heart, felt there is absolutely something there, but I’m fine except that.

March 19. Some heat around my heart and short of breathing from time to time, when it came,  I have no strength in my left arm, then it would be gone after minutes, but i was still cool about it.

March 20-21. Laid on bed whole weekend, it made me so much better when I was lying on bed. The pressure on heart got more heavy, and had to practice to breath, cause I couldn’t breath normal again. 

March 22. I realized I was ill for the first time, and decided to go to the hospital. My heart beats 111 per minute, and got a lot of heart diseases medicines from doctor. Felt terrible the whole day, the heat was driving me crazy, and the short of breathing is so terrible. I can only breathe 50 percent air in and sometimes I had to take a deep breath to get more air.

March 24-26. Everything was getting better after taking the medicine. The no strength of my left arm was gone, the short of breathing was almost gone, the heavy pressure around my heart was almost gone too! But I still got the heat and I got 80-90 percent air when I breathe. Almost felt I was back to normal.

March 27. Felt much better, but later I found there was something on my rib, which I believed was on the edge of left chest area. I don’t know how to write it by words, hoping you can understand which part of my body. And I also found out it caused a little pain in there

March 28, since the new symptom showed up, I decided to go to the doctor again, but the doctor didn’t see it’s a problem then sent me home. I could feel that all the former symptoms were coming from heart, and this one, not anymore!

March 29 to April 1st. For a while I believed I was totally back to normal, but soon the heat on my heart was back, sometimes i could feel my heart and edge of chest rib were burning like a hot knife stabbed there.

April 2nd. When I was walking back home from work, I noticed something wrong with the lowest part of my rib, it felt like it could not hold my gravity anymore, which leaded to some pain in there, and when I stopped 3 minutes to relax, my back was starting to tear apart! When I went to sleep on my right side on bed, my left abdomen was “raw”, felt like there is nothing there, no gravity, a strange feeling. 

April 3rd. Feeling like I would get worse again, and I was right. About 3pm I was in the office and doing work thing. I believed I stand there for only 5-10 minutes. My back and the lowest part of my abdomen were both starting to tear apart and it caused so much pain until I could not stand anymore. I used all my strength to get back to my chair and soon I felt something in my throat, had a little cough for 20 minutes(I always have the coughing problem), then all the symptoms were gone. WTF just happened?

April 5th to 7th. Laid on bed a lot, I also found out there was at least 5 parts of my body could tear apart ,bringing a lot of severe pain when I stand quiet in a place, actually walking could be much better. And also I could feel there was at least 8 parts of my body could have instant pain. Once one part gets the instant pain, it will last for 1-2 minutes, then it will be gone, but soon one of the other part begins again! Of course with the burning feeling around my heart and rib area!

April 8th-10th. Went to hospital all 3 days. told the doctor what happened these days. And I got lot of exams for every of my organs, yes, every organs! It turned out they are all fine. Did X chest rays, both heart and lungs are fine, the doctor said it’s not Covid-19！Heart beats 107 times  per minute! The doctor got confused about the body pain, “it could be the nerve causing them from heart disease, but it shouldn’t goes all over your body, most most of the patients don’t act this way like you”. Then I got a new medicine to get more blood for my heart, then I was sent to home to see what it would happen next. 

April 11th -17th. Finally I started to recover slowly. All the symptoms went down day by day. Some day it got worse, but next day I would get much better again. Forgot to mention, I have heat feeling on my left armpit and bad stomach all the time from the beginning.

April 18th. I was good all the time, except had a bad feeling in my throat which I have never had before, like there are glasses in there, but gone after that day.

April 20th. The symptoms are still there, but none bad or severe pain anymore. When I went to sleep, had a short of breathing. Afraid to forget how to breath when I fell asleep, but nothing got worse and it was gone next day.

April 21st -30th. Recovering well, but I noticed the short of breathing came back 1-2 twice a day. When it came, I felt it’s coming from pneogaster, not heart, it felt so strange like when I breathe, I can feel my pneogaster.  I wears mask all the time, when I breath covered by mask, my nose and pneogaster would get prrety warm, it would be on 30 minutes and I have never had this feeling before. Also I realized there was heat on my eyes skin all the time. When I closed my eyes, I can feel sore ,heat and tiredness, and I believe it’s not normal at 10 am or 2pm. I can feel it all the time. It was on 29th, I believed I had another server pain, I was siting on my chair, my lover back started to tear apart causing a lot of pain, then I just stand and walk to get better. It’s weird comparing to the former pain beginning with quiet standing. Also I had some pain 4 times on my whole left arm, it would last maybe 1 hour or less, it’s a strange pain with nerve, I guess so.  There were 3 days when I had some sensitive feelings in my left arm and mouth and my tongue, it’s like everything touched my skin or any food touched my tongue, I would feel they were getting me uncomfortable feelings, it’s so strange and not sure how to describe it! 

Now, I’m still recovering, maybe 80-90 percent back to normal. I guess I need more patience to get to completely symptoms free. Before it began, I want to be a volunteer to help more life who I could save, I just couldn’t watch people get infected by this virus and die! but I got my own problem in the end.

Sorry about my English, if someone would help correct the wrong writing, it would be helpful.

Mucus, cough, fever etc.   Right after, I developed slight vertigo.  Eventually February came around and I developed ear pressure and facial tension to join the vertigo coming out of my right eye.

This lasted for a couple weeks, then my vertigo seemed to go away! (although when I closed my eyes, I would still sway side to side).  

Even though the vertigo went away, I developed a heavy head pressure.  Almost like my head was being squeezed.  It would move around my head and in my face causing me to be lightheaded.

Went to the doctor.  He said it was possibly an inner ear infection with potential inner nerve damage.  Hmm

So it’s been a month since that diagnosis.  I still have this heavy head pressure! It feels like it’s going to explode.  On top of that I’m getting weird sensations in my body.  Cold hands.  Burning feet.  Throbbing all over.  Numb legs at random moments.

And the worst one is the heart palpitations.  It feels like my heart is beating hard.  Physically moving my body and head.  It feels a little slow to react (whatever that means)...and when I’m laying on my back, neck touching my chest, I get shortness of breath.  I have better relief when I lay on my stomach.  

Early on when I had these symptoms, my heart would beat fast when I got anxious, but now I can physically feel it beat hard.  And that’s when I’m just laying down.

Male 36yo, I've been getting very strong heart palpitations every night for the past year, strong beating follow by my heart stopping for a second and then a louder more explosive beat to begin again. They happen specifically after I eat dinner/late snack, when I lay down for bed, or get excited emotionally. I'm also a vaper and they happen when I vaped, so I switched to non-nicotine vape liquid and this didn't change anything. 

I live in SE Asia and recently traveled 3hr into a larger city to see a doctor. He did EKG and ultra-sound. I told him I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse when I was 18 and he said my EKG showed signs of my mitral valve doing something but I couldn't really understand what he meant. He said not to worry about the palpitations and gave me trimetazidine 35mg twice a day. After 10 days he said if the medicine doesn't help then I should come back and see him again.

My 10 day supply is almost gone and I don't know what to think, sometimes the medicine helps but sometimes it doesn't change my palpitations at all. If I take it early evening it seems to help more and if i forget and take around 9pm the palpitations usually come on strong. Going to see this doctor is a big inconvenience, 3 hour journey each way and I have to leave work. I didn't really realize until I got back home that i didn't understand if he said to buy more trimetazidine when I ran out or to just take them to help and see if the palpitations stopped. **Does this seem like an appropriate medicine if he is correct about my mitral valve causing the palpitations?

245,Different diagnosis from two doctors,3,ebdpjz,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/ebdpjz/different_diagnosis_from_two_doctors/,4,"My boyfriend and I were travelling Colombia a couple of months ago and he started having heart palpitations in the evening and morning. We went to see a doctor and had a Holter monitor test which showed irregular heartbeat all throughout the night - the heart slowing down significantly (lows of 29 bpm) to then racing (up to 190 bpm). This was happening while my bf was sleeping and he didn't feel anything. We were referred to a cardiologist who referred us to an electrophysiologist who diagnosed Sick Sinus Syndrome and said only solution is a pacemaker. He said if we don't get it my bf will soon start feeling dizzy and fainting (note the only symptom so far has been the palpitations; no headaches, no dizziness, no fainting, no weakness..)

So we cut our trip short and flew back to the UK. Waited a month to see a specialist in London who (basing himself on the same holter results as the previous one) said it's not SSS but Atrial Fibrillation, and because my bf is young (30yo) no treatment is recommended at this point as risk of stroke is minimal. He said we can go back travelling if we want or do whatever, no worries. 

How de we know which doctor was right? My first thought was to get another opinion, which we would need to do privately as NHS rarely allows them. Is there a website that I can use to find another specialist? How do I find a good one? Does anyone here have experience with being misdiagnosed?

I have an ascending aortic aneurysm, known about it since 2011 and over the years it’s been stable.

However, this year I have conflicting test results from two different cardiologists and it’s driving me batty. So I go in for an echocardiogram. Doctor saw a shadow on my heart she thought was related to a silent MI so ordered a left heart cath procedure (Aortogram). She told me the echo showed the ascending aorta at 4.4cm - which was no appreciable change from the previous year so I thought OK good.

So I have the aortagram, and as I’m waking up from the conscious sedation the interventional cardiologist tells me when they filled the aorta with dye to measure it, the measurement showed 5CM - .6MM growth over the prior 11 months. He pulled the surgery alarm, stating that I was likely going to need surgery in 6 months (from the end of July). They wanted also to do a CT Angiogram w/contrast.

About 3 or so weeks later I have the CT angiogram. And I wait for results and follow up app’t with my main cardiologist. Meet with her and she says “Oh, well your aorta is 4.5CM according to the CT.

I recorded both appointments with permission from both doctors. I go back and listen to the one who performed the aortagram and he said about the measurement “What we measure is what we measure, because we will it with dye and what shows is the measurement of the inner lumen. The outer measurement may be actually a smidge larger”.

So I contact the doc who did the aortagram for further comment and he will not reply to me. I was unable after 3 attempts to get him to reply and tell me anything.

My regular cardiologist said “Well check it again in a year. I want to see you back in 6 months” - the same interval of time the other cardiologist was saying was going to be the determining time for surgery.

I don’t know if one doctor isn’t telling me the truth because she doesn’t want me freaked out about the surgery or what.

I hope someone can shed some light on whether or not an aortagram done as part of a left heart catheter procedure would produce accurate measurements of the ascending aorta.

251,"Red Meat, Saturated Fat, Cholesterol & Heart Disease",3,d5rfv2,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/d5rfv2/red_meat_saturated_fat_cholesterol_heart_disease/,0,"If you’re like me and been alive for more than a few decades you’ve undoubtedly heard the alarming warnings that you should avoid eating red meat, saturated fat and cholesterol because they will give you heart disease and eventually kill you. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but that’s just B.S...Bad Science!

This misinformation has been at the foundation of heart health nutritional advice from the medical community for the better part of the last half-century, but yet, even after following this advice for decades heart disease remains the #1 cause of death for both men and women worldwide.

To understand how meat, saturated fat, and cholesterol got such a bad wrap we need to go back in time briefly to the year 1955 when a physiologist named Ancil Keys introduced the lipid-hypothesis which has become known as the “diet-heart” hypothesis. This study found that when cholesterol levels increase the incidents of heart disease increase and when you reduce cholesterol in the diet the incidents of heart disease decreases.  Keys and his cohorts found that saturated fat raises cholesterol more so than unsaturated fats do and since saturated fats are found principally in red meat, then red meat must be bad for your health they surmised. 

Later Keys followed up his lipid-hypothesis study with his seven-countries studies in 1970 which supported his earlier work and showed that countries whose populations consumed lower amounts of saturated fat had relatively lower levels of heart disease………...However, in retrospect, it was found that Keys had handpicked the small number of seven countries that fit his theory while ignoring the fifteen countries whose populations consumed higher levels of saturated fat but yet showed no increase in the incidents of heart disease,

However, despite the questionable science of Keys two studies, they became the foundation of the nutritional advice of the mainstream medical community for the past six decades(Heart disease is still the #1 cause of death despite following these recommendations). This advice says“ Eating foods containing saturated fats raises the levels of cholesterol in your blood and high levels of LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk of heart disease and stroke.”

But the real problem with these recommendations was that the REAL research did not support Keys assertions…...For example, the famous Framington Heart study showed that while LDL cholesterol is associated with heart disease, HDL cholesterol which also increases when we consume saturated fat decreases our risk of a heart attack. Moreover, a study that examined almost 250,000 people who’ve been admitted to hospitals for a heart attack found that nearly 75% had LDL levels that were low or optimal under the current cholesterol guidelines.

Another study, the largest of its kind at the time in 2016 compared people who were fed diets high in saturated fat to those were fed diets which removed most of the saturated fat and replaced them with unsaturated vegetable oils. They found that yes, the vegetable oil group had lower cholesterol levels, but high mortality rates, they died sooner than the saturated fat eaters… Kind of a big deal, don’t you think?

An additional study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found zero links between saturated fat and heart disease and concluded the guidelines that tell us to avoid saturated fat are not supported by scientific evidence. 

One of the biggest studies to rebuke the saturated fat guidelines and advice to avoid red meat took place in 2016. Researchers analyzed data over 16 years from 42 countries that looked at the link between the foods they consumed and heart disease ...they found NO link between saturated fat and heart disease. The foods found to be most associated with heart disease were high-glycemic carbs like bread, cereals, potatoes, crackers and pasta noodles.

Do you want more evidence that meat does not cause heart disease? Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, the #1 rated heart hospital in the world, says the evidence does not support the widely held belief that we should limit saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet”.

Furthermore, In 2017 Dr. Salim Yusuf, one of the top cardiologists in the world who is also the president of the world heart federation said “contrary to common beliefs, the current recommendations to reduce saturated fat have no scientific basis.” and when he pressed further and asked what does cause heart disease? Dr. Yusuf replied, “Refined, processed carbohydrates”...he went on to say, “When you eat a hamburger, throw away the bun and eat the meat”.

But just because meat and saturated fat have been exonerated as the cause of heart disease that doesn't mean go out and eat all the meat you can get your hands on, that's because not all meats are created equal. Some meats can and do contribute to heart and other diseases.

The real problem with meat is not saturated fat and cholesterol. The problem with meat is the types of meat we are eating.

It is imperative to understand that the meat that is most commonly sold in your local market or grocery store is not the same type of meat our paleolithic ancestors ate, it’s not even the same meat our parents and grandparents ate, the cows of today are not the cows of yesteryear.

The majority of meat today is raised on what’s known as factory farms. On these factory farms, they are confined and live in pens where they are packed in like sardines. In order to keep costs low, the cattle on these factory farms are fed a highly inflammatory diet of corn and the cheapest grains as well as what’s known as byproduct feed, which with government approval can consist of things like chicken manure and feathers, bubble gum and candy, and even some sewage products and aluminum foil. How do you think that impacts your body and health when you eat things that have literally eaten a diet of crap?... It’s not good! It’s not just about what you eat, it’s about what you eat ate! 

But it’s not just the pro-inflammatory diet these cows consume, they are often filled with hormones, and both natural and synthetic versions of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone to increase their size in efforts to get as much yield as possible from the cow when it’s butchered. 

Opponents to hormone use in meats point to studies showing that these growth hormones are linked to everything from the early onset of puberty, increasing incidence of twin births, reproductive problems, cancers, such as breast and uterine cancer, as well as developmental problems in children.

Cattle raised in these confined spaces and subsisting on a crap diet makes these factory farms raised animals more susceptible to disease and infection. Because of this factory-farmed animals are also fed large amounts of antibiotics, nearly 80% of all antibiotics in the US are used in cattle and poultry production. So what happens when you eat animals filled with these antibiotics? Well, scientists tell us that it can lead to humans becoming antibiotic-resistant, which occurs when bacteria develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. When bacteria become resistant, antibiotics can't fight them, and the bacteria multiply.

So, If you do choose to eat meat, (which I highly advocate for) stay away from the factory-farmed meats and choose organic grass-fed meats instead. Grass-fed meat is raised and eat in the way cows did throughout history before the relatively new advent of these commercial factory farms. Cows were not genetically designed to subsist on these highly inflammatory corn, grain, and crap diets. Throughout history, cattle grazed on a diet of grasses, plants and, shrubs, this is their natural diet and when raised organically without antibiotics and hormones and allowed to eat like they should while a roaming outside as opposed to being confined to pens as they are designed to do produces healthy cattle like our ancestors have eaten for 10,000 of thousands of years of human history without high levels of heart disease. In fact, there are significant health benefits linked to eating organic, grass-fed meat.

Grass-fed beef is known to be one of the more nutrient-dense proteins on earth, it has a remarkably higher micronutrient profile compared to grain-fed beef. 

Grass-fed beef contains much more of the healthy omega-3 fats, unlike factory-farmed which are much higher in the inflammatory omega-6 fats. It is also the richest source of a powerful and heart-healthy fatty-acid called CLA-conjugated linoleic acid, CLA has many known health benefits, including in the regulation of fat by the body. CLA assists in the use of body fat as a source of energy. CLA-plays a role in the prevention of heart disease, by preventing the deposition of plaque and lipids in arteries, this is a key factor in the development and progression of heart disease. CLA may also help prevent heart disease by acting as an antioxidant and by lowering blood pressure.

Another reason to eat grass-fed meat is that animal protein is the single best source of protein and it is the only natural source of  Vitamin B12. To put it simply, eating the right type of meat is both tasty and healthy. One of the other biggest knocks against meat was its fat and cholesterol content, but again we know that’s BS, Bad Science. So much so the USDA removed its recommended limits for dietary cholesterol and fat consumption in 2015, why? Because as we established in detail the science simply does not back up the previous negatively associated health concern with saturated fat and cholesterol.

However, with all that said, the one drawback to organic and grass-fed meats is their cost. The cost of raising organic and grass-fed meats are much higher to the farmer and producers, so it costs us more at the store. 

Deciding to eat meat is a personal choice, but eating the right types of meats, won't give you heart disease and kill you. 

Just remember you want to choose organic grass-fed beef and lamb, organic pasture-raised pork as well as bison, elk, and venison. You want to stay away from conventional factory-farmed beef, lamb or pork, conventionally processed meats to keep yourself your healthiest. https://TheHealthyHeartCoach.com",2019-09-18 02:40:01+00:00,[],252

263,Do I have Atrial Fibrillation?,3,b59zgr,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/b59zgr/do_i_have_atrial_fibrillation/,7,"Hello, I'm a 14 year old male and I've had a rough couple of months with my heart recently. About 10 weeks ago, I had very mild chest discomfort and a faster heart rate (100-120bpm even when sitting down) that went on and off for an hour or so a day over the course of a week.

I felt like I went back to normal, but I noticed that my resting heart rate, no matter what I was doing, was constantly higher than it should be (used to be 72-76bpm, now hangs around 85-90bpm). I would get the sensation of a harder beating heart often, and found it more difficult to do as much sporting activity as usual. 2 weeks after everything had gone, I woke up suddenly at night with a fast heart rate (120-150bpm) and a couple of what I think were ectopic beats.

Since then, there have been four occasions at night where I wake up with a fast heart rate (120-150bpm), accompanied by ectopic beats. I counted four of these ""skipped beats"" in the course of two minutes in my most recent episode. Sometimes I also start uncontrollably shaking. My heart rate calms down within an hour or two but I feel like I am recovering from a sickness for a day or two after an episode.

Do I have Atrial Fibrillation, or is it something else? I went to the doctors where they did an ECG on me, which was normal (but of course they weren't recording my heartbeat when in an episode). I'm booked into a cardiologist in 2 weeks.

Blood tests would be a good idea, too. Your doctor might ask you if your family has a history of heart problems; if you can, ask around your relatives to find out if there is anything historical there.\n\nYour descriptions are coherent with some form of arrhythmia (where your heart beats irregularly), but there are many different types with many causes.

White, 6'3"", male, non-smoker, roughly 175 pounds. 26 years old. Heart problems in both sides of the family. I was born a pretty sick child with asthma. I have also have a long history of heart palpitations and, most recently, lost my entire colon to ulcerative colitis.  


So last year I was working out quite regularly but I came down with a slight cold, coupled with eye strain and migraines. This followed with a bout of crushing chest pain that almost made me pass out at the dinner table. Thankfully this passed after 5 minutes, but I was screwed up after this. I could barely walk up the stairs without getting winded, I had this feeling of constant pressure on my chest with random episodes of stabbing pain.  


Fast forward to 2019 and I'm doing a little better but I find myself unable to work out and most of my symptoms are still present. Walking up stairs still does me in, lifting heavy objects causes rapid heartbeat and makes me winded. Bending over (to do up my shoes) does the exact same thing, strangely. My chest pains come and go in the form of stabbing episodes.  


I've had an EKG, stress test, nuclear MRI and a MUGA scan. The only test that really showed anything was the EKG, which showed that my ejection fraction was less than 45 percent. The (later) MUGA scan said it was roughly 56 percent. That, and they noted that my blood pressure seems to go from high to low.  


Now I want to trust my doctor but he seems kind of lost and he wants me to go on an anti-anxiety drug. His assistant/student, on the other hand, seems adamant that something is actually wrong here, proposing angina as a possible culprit.

This started last Saturday when I had some chest pain that turned into a burning in my chest/neck which subsided but left me with lingering pain. I had thought it was a bad case of heartburn so I waited until Wednesday but I had an anxiety attack Tuesday night because I felt some tightness/slight numbness in my left forearm. 

Long story short, I went to an urgent care clinic first. They did an EKG for me. The physician informed me that their was a slight abnormality and he was worried about oxygenation or something and urged me to go to the ER for testing right away. So that's what I did, I arrived at the ER and when it was my turn I handed the nurse the results of my EKG at the urgent care clinic. They proceeded to ask me more about my symptoms and my history (very accommodating) before setting me up for another EKG at the hospital as well as drawing my blood for testing. I had to wait about an hour or two but eventually I was greeted by one of the doctors on staff in the room I was in where they had me hooked up for my vitals. The doctor asked me about my chest pain, I explained a bit to him. He proceeded to tell me that my EKG was normal, my blood work results were good and that I have a healthy heart and healthy lungs. I was pretty dumb-founded but relieved. He inspected my chest with his stethoscope for a moment and then said ""Yeah, I'm sending you home."" I was super relieved but I had to ask him like that's it? I'm good? He said yes and that it's most likely a bad case of acid reflux/esophagitis or potentially inflamed ribs/stomach. They didn't prescribe anything, and cleared me to return to work the next day. I told him I was taking Pepcid AC and it seemed to provide relief so he suggested I just keep taking it regularly. The relief for me was overwhelming but has since prompted me to make some lifestyle/diet changes.

I'm only left with a few concerns:

1) My chest pain has very much subsided, have been taking the Pepcid. However, I'm still experiencing a slight numb/weakness in my arm, not pain. Today in particular (a week later), it almost feels like my left arm in the forearm/wrist area is asleep or like I've been sleeping on it. I'm not sure if this is unrelated.

2) When the hospital took my blood work I'm curious if they look for anything else that's off in my blood work or just related to what I'm there for? Would they have informed me if I had bad cholesterol?

The thing is, the ER doc told me he has no idea what caused my heart to do that but it is not normal and it needs to be taken care of and a lot of cardiologists just brush off young people, but he said don’t mention anxiety EVER to a cardio because it’s an easy pass for them to not treat you.. just tel then your life is perfect and normal and you have no anxiety and push for tests. Do a stress test, do the dye test and get scans of your heart, not just chest x rays, do everything you can to get a diagnosis. You are too young to have this happen and honestly if you don’t take care of it now, it can get worse. For example if you did have, say, POTS syndrome, I used to be hella active, like I biked everywhere, like long distance 25 miles, I was in water surrounds, ballet, Zumba, I swam every day, I did crunches and ran on the treadmill and because I didn’t know I had POTS I wasn’t treating my body right and now I’m practically couch ridden. Had I know. Sooner, I could probably still be healthy and fit. I can’t even run after my son, I can’t bring him to the park during the day. He knows all the other kids go there and he has to sit home with me because I could have an episode. It’s really sad and horrible. Please get this figured out before you turn out like me. A lot of things can be so hard to reverse. ']",280

Thanks in advance!",2018-03-14 20:36:23+00:00,"['Long answer but hopefully will answer all your questions.  I\'m happy to provide more, if you have any questions: \nI am a 37-year old female and was diagnosed with coronary artery plaque (beginnings of heart disease) last June.  Family history: my dad had a quadruple bi-pass at age 42, and a triple at age 65; he also has 6 stents in his arteries right now.  One of the bi-passed arteries in the most recent one failed because his heart grew it\'s own artery on the back side so it caused the new one to collapse...he\'s a freak LOL!; Dad\'s mom had two heart attacks during her lifetime; his sister and brother have both had quadruple bi-passes (not sure of the ages on any of those).  My mom\'s mom died during bi-pass surgery in her 60\'s; her sister has had two heart attacks (I think in her 60\'s, but she may be in her 70\'s at this point), and two of her brothers both died from massive heart attacks in their 50\'s.  Then in February of 2017, my sister (at age 42...the same age that my dad had his first bi-pass) had a heart attack and subsequent stent put in.  So last year I went to my primary (family) doctor and asked what the options were for screening my heart.  I had not had any symptoms, am not a smoker, am active, mildly overweight but not near obese, my blood pressure and cholesterol were both in normal ranges; he hesitated to have me do anything because the ONLY factor I had was family history.  So I pushed, insisting that I needed to know, especially after my sister having a heart attack.  He told me that because I had no symptoms, my insurance wouldn\'t cover it, but that I could have a heart CT scan done, and to call around because some places offered deals if you were paying cash.  So I shopped around and paid out-of-pocket to have one done.  I had my scan done at 3:00 on a Thursday...the doctor called me at 8:00 the next morning and said ""you have heart disease.""  I wasn\'t surprised, given all the family history, but he was shocked because I had no symptoms or lifestyle factors that would have contributed.  He sent me to a cardiologist, who put me on a statin to lower my cholesterol and a low-dose aspirin regimen; even though my cholesterol wasn\'t over the maximum, it was toward the higher end of the range and he wanted it down towards the middle or lower end; he also said that people my age with this type of heart disease will have heart attacks because the plaque ruptures, not because the arteries get completely clogged, and that the statin would help prevent the plaque from rupturing also.  I still have no symptoms, the lowest dose of the statin brought my cholesterol down into the lower end of the range so the statin and aspirin are all I\'m doing at this point medication-wise.  I joined weight watchers a few months ago and am working on getting my weight down into the ""average"" range.  I told my brother to go get the heart scan done too, since he is older than me, even though he doesn\'t have any symptoms either.  I also notified my extended family to get checked.  I have since discovered that I have other contributing factors though: I was diagnosed with Hashimoto\'s disease over 20 years ago (in high school), and after I was diagnosed with the heart disease, I was also diagnosed with hereditary Hemochromatosis; I have since found out that there is a possibility that  Hashimoto\'s can contribute to the Hemochromatosis, and both the Hashimoto\'s and Hemochromatosis can contribute to heart disease...so they are all linked in a way.  I changed my medication for the Hashimoto\'s from a synthetic to a natural medication (which actually eased a lot of the Hashimoto\'s symptoms I was dealing with) and go every 8 weeks to donate blood to control the Hemochromatosis.

* She says she feels very tired (when asked what exactly she felt, she described it as her heart feeling heavy or tired) and resting helps.

* She is not out of breath nor does she have trouble breathing, it's purely the feeling of exhaustion and the odd feeling in her chest.

304,Caring for Your Heart | Quick guides for heart failure,3,70ta7r,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/70ta7r/caring_for_your_heart_quick_guides_for_heart/,0,"Heart disease is a very deliberating condition for many people around the globe. According to reports from the CDC, heart disease is the leading killer. Some risk factors make some individuals susceptible to heart disease. Risk factors can be either non-modifiable or modifiable. Non modifiable factors are factors which you can control such as family history or genetics. Modifiable factors are factors you can control, such as smoking, diet, and body weight.
Your lifestyle choices can influence your heart health. Lifestyle changes can help you reduce the chance of getting heart disease. Some positive lifestyle changes that can help you care for the heart include:
1.	Diet and Nutrition
Diet and nutrition can play a great role in preventing heart conditions. Taking a perfect diet especially one low in cholesterol or high-density lipids can reduce your risk of getting heart disease. This has also been seen to work even for those with a family history or genetic predisposition for heart conditions. A diet high in whole grains, raw fruits, vegetable and omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent heart disease. A good example of a perfect diet for your heart is the Mediterranean diet that focuses on:
•	Eating fish at least 2 times a week
•	Limiting intake of red meat to once or twice a month
•	Eating herbs, olive oil, and nuts which have healthy fats (LDLs)
•	Increasing servings of whole grains, fruits and vegetables
You also need to keep away from or limit foods that can worsen heart disease if you are already a victim. They include foods:
•	With high amounts of sugar
•	High amount of salt. 
•	Alcoholic beverages
•	Hydrogenated fats such as margarine 
Watching the amount of calories you consume in a day is very important. You should know how many calories you take in a day. Always go for foods high in nutrients but low in calories.
2.	Quitting Smoking
The most important step you can take to lower the risk of heart disease is quitting smoking. Smoking is believed to be one of the leading risk factors for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Smoking can cause buildup of fats in the arteries that cause hardening of arteries (losing their elasticity). Smoking can also cause damage to other body organs causing your body to work abnormally increasing your risk for heart disease or conditions. Smoking also reduces the amount of high density lipoproteins or good cholesterol which cause stress on the arteries.
Quitting smoking has been proven to reduce risk of heart disease. There are positive effects experienced after quitting smoking such as decrease in blood pressure, improved blood circulation and increase in oxygen supply. 
Such changes can improve your energy levels making physical exercise easier. After quitting smoking, your body heals with time, reducing the chances of getting heart disease. You should also avoid other smokers since secondhand smoking can also affect your health.
3.	Management of Diabetes
Diabetes is another leading risk factor for heart disease. Diabetes causes harmful effects on many organs if it is left untreated. Diabetes can cause stroke and peripheral artery disease among other complications. If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, manage the condition well to prevent heart disease. 
Prevention measures a diabetic patient can take to prevent heart disease include:
•	Regular exercise
•	Taking a healthy diet
•	Getting regular blood sugar checkups from your doctor
You may also need to manage diabetes with medications. Limiting the effects of diabetes can help reduce your risk of heart disease.
4.	Regular Exercise
Exercising regularly can help you maintain a healthy weight which is vital in lowering blood pressure and preventing heart conditions. According to recent studies, getting at least 30 minutes of physical exercise a day is recommendable to avoid heart disease. Physical exercise does not need to be intensive. 
The main goal of exercising is to maintain a healthy weight. You therefore need to balance the amount of exercise you perform in a day with the number of calorie intake. You should also find out your body mass index (BMI), which you can use to set weight loss goals. 
Physical exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight, therefore avoiding high blood pressure and heart disease.
5.	Lowering Blood Pressure
Hypertension or high blood pressure can cause stress on the cardiovascular system, contributing to heart disease development.  Below are ways you can lower blood pressure:
•	Managing stress
•	Quitting smoking
•	Low intake of salt
•	Diet
•	Exercise
•	Weight management
•	Reducing alcohol consumption
You should work closely with your doctor to help monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis in case you are a victim of the condition. You should also take all prescribed medications as directed. Since it is difficult to detect high blood pressure, you should visit your doctor whether you have it or not.
6.	Stress Management
Stress affects everyone but in different ways. For example, there is a link between individuals who experience high amounts of stress over a long period of time and heart disease. Stress can also cause pain, sleep loss, exhaustion and headaches that can cause your heart to beat harder. This can worsen other risk factors of heart disease you may have.
You can avoid stress through:
•	Adapting a stress-reducing environment
•	Physical exercise 
•	Relaxing exercises such as yoga
•	Letting go the life worries
•	Spending most time with friends and family
•	Having enough sleep
When to See Cardiologist
Heart disease is easy to treat when it is detected early. You should therefore talk to your doctor about any concerns regarding your heart health status. If you are worried that you may develop heart disease, see a cardiologist to get steps that you can take to reduce heart disease risk. This is very important for you especially when you have a family history of heart disease. If you think you have symptoms or signs related to heart disease, you should make an appointment to see a cardiologist. Such symptoms include;
•	Chest pain
•	Fainting
•	Breath shortness
These are regarded as severe symptoms of heart disease which requires emergency attention.

Supplied by Medtronic and Boston Scientific, the videos add further utility to the well-regarded CardioVisual application, which is relied upon by healthcare professionals to help patients understand complex cardiovascular problems and treatments.

The first animation, from Medtronic, is aimed at helping physicians show patients the workings of Medtronic’s miniaturized Micra transcatheter leadless pacing system. Micra, the world’s smallest pacemaker, is delivered percutaneously via a minimally invasive approach directly into the right ventricle without any wire or lead. The animation —now available on the free CardioVisual app — clearly and concisely shows this delivery mechanism, so patients fully understand the procedure they’re about to undergo.  

The second newly added video from Medtronic, a biomedical engineering specialist, is designed to help patients understand the Transradial Diagnostic and PCI Procedure, which is the newest minimally invasive approach to performing angiography and unblocking of a clogged coronary artery, with balloons or stents called angioplasty or PCI.

Boston Scientific, a global developer and manufacturer of medical devices, has contributed an animation demonstrating the use of the company’s Rotablator Atherectomy System. Rotablator  is used by physicians to break up calcium in coronary arteries in the leg or peripheral arteries.

Boston Scientific also contributed a video that demonstrates the use of their Jetstream Atherectomy System, which is engineered to treat multiple morphologies, such as calcium, plaque or thrombus, which are commonly found in total occlusions in peripheral arteries. The Jetstream Atherectomy System provides active aspiration to remove debris and help minimize the risk of distal embolization.

CardioVisual is pleased to be able to offer its users content describing the newest treatments from these two venerable giants. The new videos join a sizable library of information from numerous other companies in the cardiovascular medical device industry.

“Every piece of content we add to our app makes it stronger, more useful and current for both healthcare professionals and patients globally,” says Manish Chauhan, MD FACC, founder of CardioVisual and developer of the app. “We’re pleased to have contributions from these two leading organizations.”

Heart disease is the No. 1 killer globally, and treatments of this disease can be difficult to understand. Using content generated and curated by practicing cardiologists, CardioVisual provides healthcare professionals and patients better understanding.

Holter monitor only detected some ectopic beats and PACs. Doctor said not to worry. Eventually the problem went away except for a few episodes here and there.  
When I was 27, I started having more frequent palpations which felt worse. Long term event monitor detected some PACs and PVCs. Doctor said not to worry. Problems eventually subsided.  
Last year, my heart started racing and beating irregularly while just standing still after walking down stairs. I went to the ER and was released because they couldn't detect anything life threatening.  
Today, it happened again. I called 911, but ultimately they subsided and I opted not to go to the ER.  
Does anyone here have any advice, insight, or similar experiences.  It is drastically affecting my way of life now and my doctor isn't concerned.  Thanks for reading.

I'm a 23 year old male who had somewhat of an uncommon occurrence happen to me in December of 2015. One day I was experiencing weird symptoms, indigestion, chest pain, anxiety. I thought nothing of it. Over the course of the next few days I ended up feeling worse and worse and I ended up walking one morning with my left arm numb and unable to move with chest pain and a headache with anxiety. I was admitted to the hospital. My cardiac enzymes were damaged and we did every test in the book. Since then, I've felt weird almost off. My left arm constantly hurts, I consistently have a headache, my legs and muscles spasm and my heart gets random stabbing pains with low heart rate. The doctors have done every single test in the book (besides an angiogram). Muiltiple EKG's, Stress Test, two Echo's, and chest X-rays. All came back normal. 

This week I've felt especially weird. Massive indigestion/diarrhea since Sunday, chest pain, jaw pain, left arm pain and now right arm pain (almost like I can feel the blood fill my veins in my arms), headache and left eye non stop twitch. I saw my Primary and he assured me we've done everything and my heart is fine. Yet I still get those symptoms along with a choking sensation. I'm wondering have my doctors missed something? Is this some issue that they can't see or haven't seen? Before my Pericarditis I weighed 190 at 5'11 (I was out of shape). Now I'm at 168 and in shape after working out a lot since Jan 1st. Today at the gym I had to stop myself from working out I was so worried about this pain. 

Currently my right pectoral is spasming with my symptoms. I had blood work done yesterday testing my cardiac enzymes along with a TON of other tests (thyroid, all my vitamin levels, troponin) and my alanine aminotransfe was high (it was at 64 when it should be 17-47). Is this alarming? I'm not even sure what it is. 

I have an event test coming up in a few weeks so maybe that will clear things up. I've been complaining about my chest since I was 15. My grandfather died at 43 due to a massive heart attack (he was skinny and only smoked) and my mother suffered one last year (still alive but was a major alcoholic most of her life along with smoker). I'm just wondering if I've inherited these genes. I don't have high BP or cholesterol yet I do smoke (which I am trying to reduce). Is there anyway my doctors are missing something? I've been to the ER with these pains numerous times and they have never found anything. I'm sitting here typing this while all of this is going on and it has me incredibly stressed out.

I'm a server/bartender and lately I've been perspiring more and clutching my throat trying to hide I'm gasping for air when talking to them. Is there another test I'm missing they need to do? My birthday is tomorrow and I'm incredibly worried about going out for drinks with friends. I've read numerous websites and I've heard suggestions such as an angiogram or to test the nerve endings(not sure how they do that) on my heart. I feel as though my primary doesn't take me seriously at this point. He pointed out we have a lot of data of your heart and your very young to worry about an underlying heart issue. Yet I did have Pericarditis which is rare at my age.

I'd be really interested to hear from someone if this community and or a professional. Thank you very much for reading this lengthy post.",2017-04-01 03:43:18+00:00,"[""Get a CT angio. It's non-invasive. ""]",315

In need of advice.,3,5u3udv,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/5u3udv/20_year_old_scared_for_his_life_in_need_of_advice/,3,"I used to be very active up until a year ago. I played basketball all throughout middle school and high school, I also ran a lot. I never had any symptoms whatsoever, apart from short losses of breath when I worked out, but this was very rare, it happened once every few months, so my doctor said it was nothing. I always had great exercise tollerance, always had excellent results on stress tests. My problems began during December 2015. I had always been really sensitive to caffeine, so I always drank coffee as little as possible. During this period I had a lot of tests and exams, so I decided to coffee up. Also my friend introduced me to caffeine pills, so I started taking about 50 mg of caffeine per day and also drank coffee, about 3 or 4 grams of NesCafe per day. During this time I started noticing that my abdomen started pulsating really hard, close to my navel. Also during this time while showering, I started noticing hair loss on my ankles(I have really hairy legs lol) and also a patch of dead, brownish skin on the medial side of my ankle and on my feet. During workouts I would get an extremely high heart rate, pulsating in my abdomen, shortness of breath and also I would feel  poor circulation in my calves and feet, and sometimes in my arms. The symptoms were intermittent and after I stopped drinking coffee, they lost on intensity. But during April of last year, they returned, so at the beginning of May I went to see a cardiologist. He performed and ECG, an echocardiogram, he checked my abdomen, and also Doppler echocardiography on my feet. He said that there was nothing abnormal with my heart, there was no widening of the aorta(1.4 cm), and that indeed  I had low circulation in my feet but he attributed that to stress and told me to relax more often. I still had the symptoms during the summer, but they lessened, so I started to be active once more, playing basketball, working out occasionally, and drinking coffee here and there. About 4 and a half months ago,  I noticed that the hair loss on my legs has worsened. Now it's about 6,7 cm above my ankles. Also the back of my calves is now completely hairless. Even worse I started to have chest pains upon exertion, when walking up stairs, carrying not so heavy objects, and sometimes while walking faster than my usual tempo. In other words I get chest pains doing trivial, everyday activities. A few days ago I noticed that I'm starting to lose hair on my arms as well. I don't feel like this all the time; the symptoms are intermittent. Sometimes during this episodes of chest pain and poor circulation I feel throbbing sensations in my arms, legs and abdomen.Don't know if this is important or not,  but the last two years I've been seriously balding. Almost forgot to mention, the last 2 weeks I've been having a terrible case of constipation, even though I eat adequate amounts of fiber
Long story short, I'm afraid that these might be symptoms of early heart failure. I don't have any congenital cardiovascular defects, I lead a very healthy lifestyle, no smoking and healthy diet, occasional light drinking. Heart disease doesn't run in the family, although my grandma died from a heart attack in her sleep, and my other grandma died from heart failure. But both of them were pretty old, 77 and 84 years respectively. Is there any other test I can do to confirm what seems to be my problem? Any advice? I'm scared and it's having a bad impact on my social and academic life.",2017-02-14 23:24:28+00:00,"[""There is definitely something wrong.

318,21 Year Old Prescribed Beta Blocker for Hypertension,3,5an64x,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/5an64x/21_year_old_prescribed_beta_blocker_for/,1,"Hello,

I am a twenty one year old Caucasian male that is 6'5"" and 220 pounds and I was prescribed Atenolol (a beta-blocker) for hypertension this past summer. 

I had a stress EKG and my blood pressure after 4 minutes of exercise was 260/60 and after 6 more minutes of exercise plateaued at this level. My resting blood pressure was 150/80. 

I am wondering if there are any medical experts that can weigh in on if I should be taking Atenolol or not.  

**My Main Concern:**  
**What would be the long term negative side effects (after 30 or 40 years) of using beta blockers?**  
**And as a followup, should I start taking Atenolol as my cardiologist advised?**  

Some More Information Regarding my Doctor's Tests and my General Health:  

**Doctor's Tests:**  
The Test: My cardiologist had me do a full blood screening to see if there were any abnormalities in my blood and he also did a Stress Echocardiogram to check the structure of my heart.  
Result: My blood count was all normal and the echocardiogram was normal as well.  

**Family History:**  
Father: My father died of a heart attack at 51 years old and had a minor heart attack at 46 years old.  
Mother: My mother had rheumatic fever at approximately 8 years old and was hospitalized for atrial fibrillation at 52 years old. 


**My Lifestyle:**  
I tried the following regime for 2 months BEFORE having a resting blood pressure of 150/80 and a blood pressure during exercise of 260/60:  
Sodium: Limited to 2000mg per day  
Caffeine: 50mg per day (just from tea)  
Alcohol Consumption: 10 standard drinks once every 2 weeks  
Smoking: none (no cigarettes or marijuana)  


**My Weight:**  
Is my weight of 215 pounds at 6'5"" something I should lower?
I was thinking about getting down to 200 pounds but I am a pretty healthy 215. Here are some tidbits that could better help explain what kind of shape I am in.  
1. I would estimate my body fat percentage to be at about 18%.
2. I exercise 2-3 times a week and have enough stamina to play full length basketball games and I run a 7 minute mile.
3. I can also dunk a basketball very easily on a 10 foot regulation hoop.  

**My Doctor's Main Concern:**  
He told me that his main concern was not how high my blood pressure got during exercise but how rapidly it rose. **He diagnosed me with Exercise Induced Hypertension.**  
What worried him was the rate of increase of my blood pressure during exercise:  
Start of Stress Test: 140/80  
2 Minutes in: 220/70  
4 Minutes in: 250/70  
6 Minutes in: 260/65  
8 Minutes and 10 Minutes was about the same at 250-260/60-65",2016-11-02 01:28:07+00:00,"[""Hi Rating, your family history could indicate something, you are young but I would take this seriously. I was put on atenolol when I was 26, im now 41. I took the drug till this year when I stopped. beta blockers are bad for psoriasis which I have so I wanted to see if I could go off it. my blood pressure went higher after stopping, around 140 over 90 and my dr advised I would likely have to continue on another bp controlling med like an ace inhibitor but we were going to wait another month and wait and see. I never returned to the dr again as my work schedule took me out of town. but a couple of months later I ended up in the hospital with a high bp, rapid heart irregular beat up to 190 bpm, and heart failure like symptoms. I don't blame my dr, I blamed myself for not returning to the dr. I have yet to see a cardiologist, im still waiting ( I live in Canada and healthcare sometimes sucks up here) but my condition was likely an enlarged heart caused by high bp, or could have been an underlying condition I have always had. basically what im taking forever to tell you here is that you may have a hereditary heart problem.

It mostly feels like missed beats (like ectopics are usually described), but on a rare occasion it feels for a fleeting moment like there's no steady rhythm at all (like aFib is sometimes described). Then it usually settles down only to be repeated on the same day, the next day or at minimum within a week. During these my average pulse is not particularly high - usually between 70 and 100 like it always is for me when I'm awake.

I've cut down caffeine and alcohol, I don't smoke anything and I've been trying to get more sleep, but no improvement.

Now, I've had ECG taken, been to a cardiologist for an echocardiography, had the bloodworks etc. Everything looks **normal**, apart from the ECG which the machine thought was abnormal (incomplete rBBB among other possible issues), but the cardiologist said the graph was within acceptable limits for ""normal"".

All that reassurance, and yet I feel like I'm going to die suddenly any day now, or at least within a year or whatever, and given my current family situation that just wouldn't be nice.

So on July 11th I found out during a heart cath I had a 90 percent blocked LAD. Never any issues before or even any heart pain. Bad family history so that was why I was even having tests done. Had 2 stents put in.

For 3 to 4 days after hospital I felt on top of the world for catching this before having a heart attack. They put me on blood thinners and aspirin. They also doubled my Bystolic bp meds.

After those 3 or 4 days I feel heavy beats in my chest, sometimes throat, sometimes stomach. Had 48 hour holter. Cardiologist says there is nothing there. But I cant stand the fact that I have this weird beat now, its like a normal beat, but i just feel it. I also noticed that everytime I feel this its at rest. When my HR is usually under 68 or lower. Could the lower heart rate be what is making me feel this? My HR use to be in the 70s at rest until they doubled my bystolic. Now it is in the 60s at rest.

Hi
My bf has dilated cardiomyopathy
And i have borderline personality disorder..


4months ago
He was going to join the navy so he needed to do a physical test 
While he was running he just passed out.
He went to the hospital
And we found out he has a heart problem
Called dilated cardiomyopathy
Doctor said hes not VERY serious
If he takes pills( have to take it forever) he should be ok


There are many restrictions for him
Ofc no alcohol /no intensive work out/ eat very healthy etc.


The problem is i am also have mental illness called bdp
After he passed out ..I’m worried about him 24hours if he doesnt reply in 10mins I become super crazy…

When he was at the hospital
I saw him taking morphine and also when he was in massive heart stabbing pain.
I tried so hard to get rid of that horrible memories but i cant.
Everytime i think about what happend that day im just going crazy..

Everyone told me i should break up with him because of his heart.
As u guys know heart is one of the most important parts of ur body.
And my bf is only 20.

Hospital told us it might be a genetics problem …(still not sure)

When he got cold or just bit unwell
I feel like the worst situation will happen
That he will go to the hospital again ….


I love him so much
Im more worried because its”heart”
If he lost his two legs i wouldnt mind at all
But its HEART.Related to death

im scared about future
What if hes going to die before 30?
What if he passes out again
What if i marry him and my kids also have same problem???

I just came from a treadmill stress test. I'm 38 and out of shape because of battling chronic illness/pain for the past 6 years. I've barely been able to walk during this time and am slightly overweight (both reasons why I got my heart checked out to begin with). Before my illness, I was very active and exercised 5 days a week for 15 years.

I didn't make it far into the test before the tech stopped it (stopped right before level 3). My heart rate made it to 150 (was supposed to be 154) but the tech saw something on the test and decided to stop it. She showed it to a doctor who mentioned that my heart rate was high for the level of exertion but he said I was fine to go.

Can being very out of shape effect the results of the treadmill stress test? Of course the tech can't tell me anything and now I'm just worried and anxious :(

You don't need to dedicate yourself to a fitness regimen either -- though that can help and is great for you -- just get up and get active for now. Also, water! It's amazing what a little water will do, and in my case nearly every time my heart goes haywire it's because I haven't been drinking enough. You can also try to see if you can get tested for mineral deficiencies if you haven't been already, potassium imbalance can throw your heart way off. I take a high potassium electrolyte mix for this but you'll want to get tested by a doctor bc you do NOT want to mess with potassium on your own as too much is just as bad as too little. Sodium (salt) is also a player here.\n\nSome people just have faster hearts, and generally that's OK but the average tops out at 100 BPM, anything more than that *may* be cause for concern. But even 100 BPM can be completely normal for some people. \n\nLastly, how's your anxiety? Are you seeing someone for that? A doc or therapist can help give you the tools (and perhaps medication if that's needed as well) to manage your anxiety. My heart condition (SVT) is nearly indistinguishable from panic attacks and unfortunately I get pretty anxious when my heart is bugging out (who wouldn't freak out at 180 BPM!) so it's important for me to have a handle on both my heart health and my anxiety. Getting professional help for both has helped me to be able to recognize the difference between the two and manage them as best I can.

She said that this was most likely an anxiety attack (I’ve never had one before) and gave me a small dosage of hydroxyzine and propranolol. 

Though, the night this happened, I thought I was going to faint hours before.

This sent me into complete panic mode and was pacing around my backyard for three hours because I felt as if I stopped pacing, I would faint and not wake back up. 

The only alarming things at the urgent care was my blood pressure for me. Doc said it was “kinda high”. I believe the measurement was 144/99? Could this have been because of my “anxiety attack”.

The lady even had a hard time sticking the ECG things on to me because of how tense my chest and body was. Mentioning the ECG, she said that all looked good too but I looked at the paper after the visit and saw that there was a little note saying that I had an enlarged right atrium? Anyone know what that means and if I should worry about it?

Now, ever after since this attack which I believe occurred in late March of this year, I have not been the same. I live in constant fear for my life and can’t even sleep anymore because I am hyper focused on my chest and heart rate. The propranolol helps during the day but not at night. It only seems that I get heart palps at night when I’m thinking about them. Is that possible? Also lately, I cant even stand anymore without even feeling lightheaded and dizzy. I’ve also been getting very, very dull pains in my heart/left chest that subside in a quarter of a second probably. I honestly think I’m developing a serious hypochondria disorder and I’m going to see a psychiatrist for this time this week to see what she thinks. I spend hours a day on google looking at my symptoms. Also I haven’t drank alcohol for 2 weeks after drinking nearly everyday for 3 months and have severely cut back on my nicotine intake. Also, these palpitations do not hurt at all and are not followed by shortness of breath, they are simply a flutter in the center of my chest that goes away after half a second. 


To summarize: heart palpitations with no pain and very dull chest pains only at night. I have dizziness and lightheaded when I stand that doesn’t seem to subside at all unless my mind in completely taken off of it. I don’t do good in social settings anymore because it triggers my fight or flight. Doc thinks it’s only anxiety. Do y’all think it’s worth seeing a cardiologist?

359,Heart problem or Anxiety?,2,my3yvs,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/my3yvs/heart_problem_or_anxiety/,3,"I am 25, from the age of 23 I am facing  problems of Sinus Bradycardia and Sinus Tanchycardia. 2018, my heart rate went up to 138 and came back down to 42 during sleeping at night time (halter report). It is very very uncomfortable for me. My doctor said (2018) to live with it, else I will have to go through cauterization process now but later a pacemaker might be needed if I go with the cauterization now. He also said to reduce weight I was 102kg back then (now 84 kg) and he gave me a medicine Ramipril 2.5 (high bp like 140/80 or 150/80) which is a blood pressure medicine. 

Since then I haven't visited him again, I am taking ramipril 2.5 till date. 

2019 was a peaceful year where I faced some extra heart beats which I endured every now and then, mild palpitations etc. From 2020 I started hardcore working out at my home during lockeown. I never felt any heart issues back then, just once in a while heart extra beats or PVC, PAC whatever you refer it as. 

2020 November, my anxiety came back, I won't lie, humiliate me if you want, I was doing nofap for 260 days, and in october I gave up because I was so bored at my home and had noone to talk to etc. After I relapsed I felt guilt and my anxiety hit me hard, and then I started having severe palpitations, PVCs or PACs (I don't know what) and one time my heart started beating so abnormally at night I couldn't breathe well for 2/3 minutes. I rushed to doctors, one doctor talked me through it about 20 minutes and he said it's all anxiety, it will go away. But he prescribed me Metolar XR 25 mg. So later I started taking the med and it did go away (with the help of med), but the thing is my body is fighting that medicine hard. I can't tolerate Metolar 25, I felt like falling down when I am on my scooter, I felt lightheaded and breathless when I am walking and felt a strange pressure on my chest during the period I was consuming the medicine. So I talked to that doctor again and he said me to stop taking Metolar and go back to Ramipril. I did what he said and I became normal. I am working now and I go to office everyday and I never felt unhealthy again. Few weeks back I felt a weird chest pressure for 5 seconds or so it felt like my heart is stopping but I checked my pulse and it was beating, I was scared a bit, but didn't tell anyone, later I felt it 2/3 times a week and now  it's gone again. I have been working from home since last week, and I am stressed out because my mother hasn't got her covid vaccine yet, she is completely dependable on me about stuffs like this, she can't use mobile phone and can't even...whatever.. I was very angry at her cause she was taking the situation so lightly and I was having fights with her randomly. My fave felt numb when I am angry and I feel my blood pressure rise as my head becomes dizzy, I am sick of arguing with her and I am also bored cause all I do is work in the morning and browse phone at night, cause I am from India and it's scary outside now. 

Today morning I had that continuous disruptive heart beat around 5am or so and I got up from bed and tried to hold my breath, it didn't stop, then I coughed and it stopped finally thanks God. It was mild, but scary. I went to pee, and I felt I was getting lightheaded slowly so I peed and ran back to my bed cause I was so scared that I was getting a stroke. I fall asleep while praying to God and when I woke up I feel refreshed. Till now I felt some of those PVC or PAC whatever but not that strong, in this situation I don't know if any doctor is available or not. 

I was curious is it my heart or my anxiety and anger causing these issues, cause I grew up in a toxic environment and the main reason of my heart problems are my family.

It's definitely not a good thing to do but I do it from time to time (I try not to make it a habit)

I've begun to notice however, that on such nights where I may only get 3-4 hours of sleep, I usually spend much of the following day with tightness in my upper left arm (around the arm pit).

I went to my GP recently because my heart rate during intensive exercise (like ultimate frisbee) was peaking at like 210, and even light exercise (like a brisk walk) would quickly bring my heart rate up to 110-120 range. I was an athlete in high school, but even in peak season I couldn't jog up a flight of stairs without breathing heavy.

She said she wasn't too worried about it, but scheduled an echo for me anyway, which came back clean. However, my symptoms were related to my exercise, and an echo is done just lying down, so I'm wondering if a treadmill stress test would be a good idea? Because my GP acted like I was paranoid for even asking about the other stuff I don't really feel like asking her about the stress test, but I don't know. Sometimes when I'm on walks/casual stationary biking I feel a little tightness/very minor irritation by my heart, but then other times I can be going on runs and feel nothing.

Should I look into scheduling a treadmill stress test myself? Does it sound like I'm paranoid more than anything? Anyone have similar experiences?",2021-01-27 08:19:27+00:00,"[""With my experience, I guess if doctors aren't recommending they might have some good reason for it. \nTry to take things slow if your heart rate increase fast, may be your heart isn't accustomed to physical stress. \nYou could try some yoga and breathing exercises before physical exercises to bring more flexibility to the body, than observe.

375,PVCs / bigeminy / trigeminy,2,l5s63j,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/l5s63j/pvcs_bigeminy_trigeminy/,4,"Since the Christmas break I -- 43M, no history of significant heart disease but plenty of history of hypochondria, and mildly high blood pressure which I take amlodipine for -- have been having strange new episodes of heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is skipping or fluttering alarmingly for about 30 seconds, then it goes back to normal. I've managed to capture several of these on a Kardia mobile, [here's a sample](https://imgur.com/a/yZ91Pdt). They have always hit me while at rest or doing very non-strenuous activities like playing guitar. Sometimes it's a consistent pattern of bigeminy or trigeminy, and other times it's more chaotic, like the sample I linked.

My doctor sent me for tests: bloodwork, ECG, and 24 hour Holter monitor. By the time I could get these done, I hadn't had an episode in weeks. Everything came back okay last Friday: ECG is normal, electrolytes all in normal range, and the Holter showed only a handful of PVCs, one PVC triplet, and one PAC. The doctor says all normal, just don't drink too much caffeine or alcohol and start exercise routine again slowly.

Did a very low-effort workout yesterday morning (9am), and had two more episodes of the same palpitations later that day (at 1pm and 5pm). Very bizarre and not sure how worried I should be, or how much I should insist on further testing.

(Almost) everything I'm reading suggests this is really not a big deal, these are uncomfortable but not life threatening and don't (usually) indicate anything is wrong. But I'm looking for a little perspective from anyone who might know more or who has experienced something similar.

edit: I should add, I quit nicotine about three months ago (had smoked half a pack a day until age 40, then switched to vape for a few years, and have now quit that).

398,List of tips of living with a heart attack?,2,hpeoh4,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/hpeoh4/list_of_tips_of_living_with_a_heart_attack/,0,"I have a lot of information about preventing a heart attack, including:

 A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries).

Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.

A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It’s crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.

Common heart attack signs and symptoms include:

* Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back
* Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain
* Shortness of breath
* Cold sweat
* Fatigue
* Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness

If you are experiencing these symptoms,  
Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don’t recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps:

* **Call for emergency medical help.** If you suspect you’re having a heart attack, don’t hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don’t have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital.Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk.
* **Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor.** Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help.
* **Take aspirin, if recommended.** Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don’t take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don’t delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.

Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or another heart attack.

Heart attack risk factors include:

* **Age.** Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women.
* **Tobacco.** This includes smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke.
* **High blood pressure.** Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that lead to your heart. High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, increases your risk even more.
* **High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels.** A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also increases your risk of a heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) may lower your risk.
* **Obesity.** Obesity is linked with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10% of your body weight can lower this risk.
* **Diabetes.** Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas (insulin) or not responding to insulin properly causes your body’s blood sugar levels to rise, increasing your risk of a heart attack.
* **Metabolic syndrome.** This syndrome occurs when you have obesity, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. Having metabolic syndrome makes you twice as likely to develop heart disease than if you don’t have it.
* **Family history of heart attacks.** If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for males and by age 65 for females), you might be at increased risk.
* **Lack of physical activity.** Being inactive contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who exercise regularly have better heart health, including lower blood pressure.
* **Stress.** You might respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack.
* **Illicit drug use** . Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack.
* **A history of preeclampsia.** This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease.
* **An autoimmune condition.** Having a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can increase your risk of a heart attack.

I have systemic sclerosis but its just being monitored right now and i have an underactive thyroid that im being medicated for.

&#x200B;

So, we have heart issues in our family, my mums cousin had something fitted to start his heart when he was quite young, my mum has heart problems, grandad, you get the picture,

&#x200B;

I seem to get palpitations a lot, when i get up out of bed in the morning, my heart goes nuts and i feel like im going to pass out, i get palpitations after eating even a few carbs, if its a lot of carbs like a pizza, im floored for several hours afterwards with palpitations.

&#x200B;

I'm working out and i keep getting a fast heart rate early on, sweating profusely, shortness of breath, severe fatigue and weakness and pain in my left shoulder and an ache down the left arm as well as chest pain, i keep feeling lightheaded, even sitting typing this

&#x200B;

I get fatigue constantly anyway, just going up stairs takes it out of me.

&#x200B;

I have a job where i walk miles each day and i try to eat healthy, limit carbs, fruit, veg, no junk food.

&#x200B;

I don't get swollen feet but i have fluid that seems to collect around my abdomen, its like under the skin and i get swollen fingers and hands often, also my face goes up and down.

I had my heart checked when i was 21 but never had these symptoms and test was clear and im wondering whether i should bother? I don't want to waste the doctors time, ive had vitamin levels checked, well, the basic ones and iron/ferritin, all are normal...i thought it was thyroid but the heart just feels messed up sometimes.

I'm slightly obese with a history of high blood pressure. Whenever i go to the doctor, my heart  rate and bp skyrocket.

I went to the doctor for an unrelated issue on Thursday and my pulse was 171 and bp was 200/100. Nurse said that was the highest she had ever measured. My heart was racing because I was so nervous and it got worse when they freaked out. Doctor wanted me to go to the ER because they couldn't get it down but I was stubborn and didn't go because I didn't want to expose myself to covid. 

I was able to get  my heart rate down but ever since Thursday, I've had this pain in my chest. It's in one concentrated area and it comes and goes. It's a burning pain  that isn't excruciating  but more of a nagging pain. This happened before and it went away but I was reading about something called aortic dissection last night which can be caused by chronic high blood pressure and its where the aorta walls get damaged and they have the potential to burst which will easily kill someone if that happens.

This stood out to me, and I do not have a lot of prior knowledge. It mainly stood out due to the word severe. I did some research and this could mean valve replacement, which terrifies me, on top of that this particular one has a high mortality rate and is complicated with ICD leads.

The part that confuses me is that it says causing severe regurgitation, but then says there is trace. Does that just mean at the time of the echo there was only trace regurgitation but this proves that at other times I have severe? I understand this is serious but how concerned should I be?

Again, not to complicate things, but on the most basic level from a surgical perspective, repairing or replacing a Tri Cuspid valve is straightforward.  However, not knowing your anatomy, and many with congenital conditions have anatomy that could present with anomolies, I would still say that the Tri Cuspid is a low flow, right sided valve that most surgeons are very skilled at managing.  The annulus and leaflets of the Tri Cuspid are such that any type of  prosthetic valve can work, if it comes to that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: diagnosed with massive heart problems after steroid abuse, too anxious about heart health to live life, don't know if my heart can even recover and almost gave up on life

&#x200B;

5 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a concentric left heart as well as right heart hypertrophy with normal RV function and good systolic LV function. I also have a right bundle branch block. 

my values are the following:  
CV: normal size,LVID: 5,2 cm

LA: slightly enlarged: 4,7cm  21,2cm\^2

RV: enlarged: RVID:  5,4 cm 

RA: greatly enlarged: 6cm, 32,3cm\^2

LV function: 61&

symmetric  LV hypertrophy

no diastolic function disability

good RV function

no pulmonary hypertonia: 4,6 mmHg

&#x200B;

I am 28 years old and this (at least that's what I believe) is the result of 8 years of continuous anabolic steroid abuse as well as regularly smokin cannabis /vaping nicotine.

I always knew my heart is not well. I ignored this and didn't care about life. 

After smoking cannabis in the last few months, I got massive paranoias and heart anxiety, feeling like my heart will explode and I will die.

This got me to get a complete heart check up as well as catheter ablation to check for Brugada syndrome.

&#x200B;

Since this incident, I quit steroids and tried to limit smoking. Every day I spend in horrible heart anxiety, wishing everything would just end one day.

I cannot find information on the internet if my heart function can ever recover. I am completely broken down, not being able to focus on my job and university, and spending most of my time thinking about life and if I will ever be ok again or if I should just accept I will die in a few years.

 They play it out fine there but as soon as we are out of there and going to the car im fucked. Im hated. And shitted on. By my folk.

Help?!,2,ftpc60,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/ftpc60/chest_and_left_shoulder_pain_is_it_a_heart/,4,"So, over the last few weeks I’ve been getting achy pain in the left side of my chest and my shoulder. It’s usually quite mild, and typically lasts for 30 minutes to an hour and a half. Just now I had the achy chest pain again, but it was worse than usual - not unbearable and I could still carry out tasks that didn’t require a lot of focus, but the pain was quite distracting. It lasted for about half an hour and came on in the span of maybe ten minutes.

Could it be a heart problem? My parents say I’m almost certainly completely fine because I’m such a low risk category (16 year old female, don’t smoke, don’t do drugs, rarely drink, healthy body weight, no underlying physical conditions). But I’m really starting to worry about it, yet I also don’t want to bother my doctor if not entirely necessary because the NHS is so busy with coronavirus. 

Could this be a serious heart problem? Should I get it checked out? Other symptoms I had just now were anxiety and (very slight) nausea and shortness of breath, but I think that could be caused by me worrying about my health rather than part of a heart problem.

Like I said earlier, I am very low risk for heart issues, but I’m also on a lot of medication - does that change anything? I take 75mg quetiapine, 4mg melatonin, 25mg sertraline, 5mg folic acid and 27mg methylphenidate daily. Could one of them be causing a heart problem?

It took about 10 min to settle down (although more like 30 to regain composure) and it felt very unsettling. I also felt like my face was very hot.

Does it feel any different to how your heart would beat faster when exercising? Or is there a particular feeling in you chest that signifies it is an “abnormal” fast heart rate? Would you expect to feel a great deal of discomfort (and even panic)? Is there chest pain/discomfort?

No known structural heart damage. Do have extensive family Hx of heart disease. Take beta blocker Nebivolol 2.5 mg sid for HTN. Also take Suboxone. 

So as the title says I have been having issues with experiencing lots of PVCs. I had been feeling them daily for about a 2 month period. At times at night they’d greatly disturb my sleep. Certain postures seemed to exacerbate them(slouching or lying down, typically). Also, a large meal would often contribute to them acting up on me. 

To my elation, they suddenly went away completely about 12 weeks ago. But, for roughly the past 5 days they have returned and it’s pretty disappointing. I believe it started again a day or 2 before Thanksgiving(FYI I did not have any particularly stressful holiday situations). 

Part of me thinks this might be related to constipation. I take Suboxone and it takes a lot for me to maintain having a normal bowel movement every morning. I still have been as of recent, but I do get the feeling that days of not having 100% full BMs is slowly backing me up. 

When they initially went away back in Sept, I just had a procedure done to reset a broken nose I suffered in a bicycle accident. It was full anesthesia with NMBA and intubation. I was also Rxd Gabapentin for pain following the surgery. I can’t remember for the 2 days following the surgery, but 2 days after I woke up and had awful loose BMs(legit seemed everything in me came out that morning). I know after that it seemed the PVCs were 100% gone and have been until recently emerging. At that time I also took oxycodone for pain for those 2 days before going back to Suboxone. Good chance that’s what caused the loose BMs, transitioning back to Suboxone, seeing as you have to wait to get into a mild to moderate w/d before returning to Suboxone. 

Now I just want to get rid of these PVCs again, because they are quite annoying. I just wish I know exactly why they stopped before. Could a backed up colon affecting the vagal nerve be the cause? Or could something else done during that surgery have remedied it(being given an NMBA or the gabapentin for some reason)?",2019-12-02 14:48:00+00:00,[],442

I get similar issues and there isn't a problem with my heart function other than it goes a bit fast sometimes and it's more than I can't cope with the fast HR and that causes all the undesirable symptoms.

Avoid caffeine in all its forms, and try to get your anxieties under control"", 'They tell you to exercise, and they usually mean running. But I\'m here to tell you that your first step should be to resistance train, especially your lower body, your leg muscles. Your leg muscles are essential for blood health and also act as ""pumps"" to keep your blood pressure regulated. Also, your muscles are consumers of cholesterol, which according to the ""overweight"" mention, you probably have some issues with that. In any case, they prevent cholesterol issues because they use cholesterol to build up.\n\nOnce you have muscles on your lower body running and ""cardio"" exercise becomes much easier, and may even reveal a heart problem if you have one, as your stamina is not weak in your muscles anymore.\n\nAnd finally, larger, active muscles consume more energy which helps burn calories in general and keeps you from being overweight or being resistant to losing weight.\n\nUnlike ""cardio"" it doesn\'t require a decent diet to resistance train, just enough protein, which you\'re likely getting. Cardio training pushes your body to the fringe of its performance and is very hard on it. The vast majority of people are running faster than their homeostatic max-output can maintain over a long-duration of time. Look at how slow marathon runners run in comparison to the average street runner/jogger. If you\'re out of shape you shouldn\'t be running to get in shape. It\'s just going to make you hate being healthy. Resistance training at least feels good even when it hurts. Or at least it doesn\'t feel like you\'re dying.\n\nBut most importantly than anything I\'ve mentioned: Resistance training is protective for the heart for the reasons I mentioned *and* it doesn\'t potentially incite a cardio-related event. It\'s very easy on the heart compared to ""cardio exercises.""\n\nOh, and increasing muscular stamina helps you stay up and moving during the stress test that cardiology will eventually put you through instead of forfeiting before they finish the test... like me.']",444
447,Question about left arm pain and heart related concern during travelling in Indian villages,2,dj4ph4,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/dj4ph4/question_about_left_arm_pain_and_heart_related/,0," 

Hello,

I came down to India for a vacation, and I used one of those Autorickshaw where I sat in the front, which had a lot of metal nuts and bolts, along with the driver sharing his seat. It was pressing against my back, neck and shoulders. I am in my early 30s.

Next day everything was fine, until that afternoon I started to get mild pain on my left elbow towards the fingers, and randomly pain on my left shoulders, more of a tingling or jolting pain, which wasnt extreme, just mild.

It lasted for 2 to 3 days, and I dont feel that today unless I actually move my hands to regenerate the effect, which isnt happening.

Last month, I did an Echocardiogram and ECG etc as its readily available in India none of the waiting period like in Canada. Met with a cardiologist right after who said everything seems normal.

So to sum up,

ECG, and ECHO cardiogram from last month was normal

Left shoulder to elbow pain without any chest pain 3 days back after the auto rickshaw incident. ( I am only concerned about this because I am more of a power lifter and nothing gave me any pains before during my regular weight lifting routine)

ECG again from yesterday - appears within normal limits.

Since I am in a remote part of India as part of travelling, I won't have access to any cardiologist for the next few days.

Can someone give me some suggestions please. At the moment, I feel normal, but I am worried about the too late aspect.

Heres the ECG

I recently underwent catheter arteriogram which measured the ascending aorta at 5 CM according to the interventional cardiologist performing the procedure...

I've known I've had an ascending aortic aneurysm since 2011. At first I was with a large HMO provider that is an all-in-one type of place, they keep constructing new facilities. You can probably guess who they are without my saying so. They found it, then balked at annual scans, and there was a period of 3 years between the first and second scan. Long story short I changed providers as my work offers a few different plans. In much better hands now.

Late June I had an echo that showed the size at 4.4 CM. Last week I underwent left heart catheter to check the coronary arteries after a suspected MI. While there the interventional cardiologist checked the size of the ascending aorta and once I was awake enough heading out of the procedure room he told me that it was at 5.

I know the breakpoint for intervention is 5.5, so I'm guessing sometime in the next 1-3 years I'll be having the open repair done with the graft of a new section of dacron aorta. Unfortunately I have no idea if aneurysms run in my family. My father might have had one, but he died of a pulmonary thrombo-embolism while in the hospital recovering from prostate cancer surgery.

I do not know the cause of my mothers' death, only that she died suddenly as did both her parents. Heart trouble does run on my fathers' side - my grandfather had 2 strokes and eventually died of a heart attack. I know what to expect as I've done my homework to understand the process, but I'd not be truthful if I said I wasn't a bit worried now that the time for surgical intervention appears to be closer.

I’ve had chronic chest pains for years, and my current cardiologist was the first one since 2011 who pursued the nuclear pharmacological stress test and found a possible cause for my chest pains.

Other cardiologists were either outright denying my chest pains could be heart related (Kaiser Permanente), or just didn’t bother sending me to the cardiac Cath lab. My hope is that because of this length of time there is no permanent damage to my heart.

It started with a night of chest pain back in early 2011 and I went to the ER.

It was okay after that day. However yesterday, at night, my heart started to hurt again and it was similar to the one from 2 months ago where the vein on the left side of the neck hurted too. It was pretty bad to the point where I had to hold my neck to endure the pain, and the pain was a weird type of pain. I slept.

It hurted barely and it made the click sound every time it beated I think. I sat upright, and the noise was gone. Now is night of the same day as I write. The pain or clicking noise is gone, but my heart hurts a little bit when I breathe in. The deeper I breathe in, the worse the pain is.

Does anyone have any experience with this condition?
It's only been a couple days but I'm terrified to move.

I'm almost 400 lbs and a heavy smoker. Also I've been following a strict ketogenic diet (high fat/protien, low carb) so when my heart started acting crazy I assumed I was having a heart attack. The ER triage seemed to think so too when they saw my ekg because they rushed me to a room with 8 or so nurses working on me and telling me to stay calm. 
Fortunately I wasn't having a heart attack and outflow tract tachycardia is mostly benign and the meds have kept my heart from beating out of my chest but I still get flutters here and there and I'm just really nervous.

The ketogenic diet has been helping me lose weight. 15 pounds in less than a month so I really don't want to give it up but I'm nervous about the amount of fats I eat everyday.
I haven't quit smoking since being diagnosed but I have cut down A LOT.

In the days leading up to my ER visit I ate very little just because I was so busy, I drank way more coffee than usual and I wasn't really sleeping a whole lot so I'm assuming all that is what triggered this initially.

So if you read through that mess (thank you and I'm sorry) here are my questions:
If you have outflow tract tachycardia/RVOT VT do you drink coffee or smoke? I can give up smoking slowly but I need caffeine to get through the day.
Can you exercise without triggering your heart to go crazy again? Sex?
In the hospital they told me to just limit my caffeine but I would like to hear from someone who actually lives with it.
Thanks!

I think the important thing to remind yourself is that your condition is not life-threatening. Anxiety can trigger episodes, so be sure you seek some help if it continues to be an issue. \n\nI can’t make recommendations for you, but I can share what helps me. I don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol, no drugs, no caffeine (not even soda or chocolate), very little sugar, do yoga and take walks, and I try to be careful with sleeping enough. It can be hard to transition into, but it helps me tremendously. \n\nI also eat very small meals and try to avoid a heavy stomach. If I’m having issues, I’ve found that laying down somewhere cool helps and sucking on ice cubes can soothe it a bit. Of course, it’s a bit of a crapshoot and sometimes I’ll pass out anyway, but I try. Be sure you’re careful and consistent with your medicine. \n\nAgain, I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Feel free to reach out if you ever need to, my friend. ', ""I'm sorry you have to go through that. I can give you some general information about the questions you asked, but the best advice is to talk with a cardiac electrophysiologist about the best plan for you. In general, the good news about RVOT VT is that it's treatable and often curable. Medications like metoprolol can certainly help control it, but it means you have to keep taking the meds. That class of medications, called beta blockers, has certain side effects that some people experience such as fatigue and erectile dysfunction that can make them less desirable. That said, for those who can take them and don't have the side effects, they're excellent medications. \n\nThe other treatment for RVOT VT, which can be curative, is called an ablation procedure. That's where the electrophysiologist comes into play. They're a sub\\-specialty of cardiologists who can do procedures to treat arrhythmias. An ablation is not open surgery, but rather a catheter\\-based procedure where they can map out where the arrhythmia is coming from in your heart and get rid of it by creating a small scar in that area. For people who have a successful procedure, it's curative... you leave with no more RVOT VT and no need to take medications for it.\n\nOk, now for the caveats and why you should speak to your doctor about it. It sounds like you certainly have risk factors for heart disease. While RVOT VT usually refers to a specific type of VT that is unrelated to heart attacks and other heart disease, the above information doesn't apply to VT related to that. Also, quitting smoking is important, regardless of what else you do. It sounds like you're losing weight, which is also great! As far as caffeine goes, it's a little controversial, but it can rev up your heart if you have enough of it, which could theoretically trigger your RVOT VT. \n\nI hope that helps! \n\n\\(Just as a disclaimer, this is meant as general information, not medical advice.

I am approaching this community because I know we've all been directly or indirectly effected by Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). This community provides support and answers that are helpful for those that are living with CHD. But more importantly, it's a learning space where we get to share the experience with others who have gone through similar scares. Personally, my father had a heart attack a couple years back, and this was a big scare not only for him, but for all of us that were very close to him. This event ultimately motivated me to combine by deep interest in health psychology with a focus on cardiovascular health. 

I feel that each patient has the right to speak up about their treatment process and experience. We all know individuals who have suffered heart attacks and currently going through rehabilitation for their conditions, however, we rarely get to hear about the life-saving and supportive details that accompany their heart disease. 

My name is Michael Park, a 3rd year doctoral candidate in Clinical Psychology at Pacific University. I am currently working with Coronary Heart Disease patients to complete my dissertation on the role of familial/social support in their ability to follow treatment in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Furthermore, I am seeking participants who are diagnosed with CHD who are willing to talk about their treatment experience. 

The purpose of this study is to identify how social support from family or friends either helps or doesn’t help CHD patients follow their treatment procedures; and why one component of treatment (i.e., diet, exercise, or medication) may be easier to follow than another. The research collected will be used to provide helpful recommendations for family, friends, and caretakers who provide support for CHD patients. 

If you are not diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease, but know someone who is diagnosed and meets the eligibility requirements below, please feel free to send this thread to them.

To participate you must meet the following eligibility requirements: 
1)	At least 18 years of age
2)	Fluent in writing and reading English
3)	Diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

526,8 Way to take Care for Heart,2,70t8bu,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/70t8bu/8_way_to_take_care_for_heart/,2,"Do you take care of your family? Goes without saying. Do you take care of your home? Of course. Do you take care of your heart? Probably not. It may not be at the top of most poeple’s to-do lists, but caring for your heart through a healthy diet and regular physical activity is the secret weapon to preventing heart disease. While many may assume that popping a few pills that your healthcare provider prescribed is enough to quell symptoms or prevent a heart attack, the real preventative power lies with real changes to your lifestyle – which can reduce the risk for heart disease by as much as 80 percent. Read on to find out how. Use the following tips to embark on a heart-healthy lifestyle to fight heart disease.
1.	Schedule a Yearly Checkup 
 Your heart is in your hands. Each year on your birthday, schedule a checkup to have your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels checked, and ask your doctor to help you reach or maintain a healthy weight. Be sure to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations, including taking prescribed medications as directed.
2.	Get Physical
 Step, march or jog in place for at least 15 minutes a day while watching your favorite TV shows. Increase your activity by five minutes each week until you're getting a minimum of 30 minutes most days of the week. If exercise and diet do not get you to your goal, ask your doctor about adding medication. Keep your numbers in check: Get Physical
3.	Drink More Water
 Take a water bottle with you wherever you go. It'll keep you hydrated and the bottle's weight will strengthen your arms.



4.	Eat Healthy
 Keep packages of unhealthy food hidden. Put raw veggies and fruits in front in the refrigerator and healthy snacks in the front of the pantry, so that's what you see first. If you grab healthy foods for a minimum of 21 times, healthy choices will become a habit. Also, look for the American Heart Association red and white heart-check mark. This easy, reliable grocery shopping tool helps you identify foods that can be part of a sensible eating plan. Keep your numbers in check.
5.	Control Cholesterol
 Eating foods high in saturated fat, trans fat or cholesterol can lead to high blood cholesterol. To help keep your cholesterol levels down, eat foods low in saturated fat and trans fat, such as lean chicken or turkey (roasted or baked, with skin removed), fruits and veggies, low-fat or fat-free dairy products and whole grains.
6.	Cut Down on Salt
 To help lower high blood pressure, watch your salt intake. It may be disguised in food labels as sodium alginate, sodium sulfite, sodium caseinate, disodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, sodium hydroxide, monosodium glutamate (MSG), or sodium citrate.
7.	Quit Smoking
 Try this four-step way to kick your habit:
•On Day 1, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke by half
•On Day 3, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke in half again
•And on Day 5, cut your smoking in half again
•On your Quit Day... quit!

8.	Maintain a Healthy Weight
 Excess weight increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. To achieve steady, painless weight loss, take it easy. Each day, if you eat 200-300 calories less than you would normally consume, and exercise at least 30 minutes on most or all days of the week, you'll get closer to your goal and be able to achieve weight loss that's steady and painless.
In addition to the physical toll a lack of exercise takes on the body, a whopping 65 percent of all American adults today are obese or overweight, increasing their risk for heart disease. So, follow these tips and make sure to care for your heart!

Designed by cardiologists, CardioVisual is used by healthcare providers in more than 120 countries to helps patients better understand their treatments, and then they send patients home with instructions to download the patient version of the free app for further study.

Facebook groups are an important and growing component of the internet’s largest social media platform, used by more than 500 million people today. Like web-discussion forums of yesteryear, these groups allow specific sets of people to share updates, links, photos and more, but with added privacy and security precautions via Facebook’s user-friendly social software platform.

CardioVisual is an Austin, Texas-based company founded by Dr. Chauhan, a clinical cardiologist who saw a need for more efficient patient communication in his own practice. The result of Dr. Chauhan’s search for better teaching tools is CardioVisual, an educational app available for all iOS and Android mobile devices, which uses carefully curated videos from authoritative sources to facilitate and simplify discussion of problems in four categories: cardiac, electrophysiology, structural heart and vascular.

I'm only 19 so I don't have many health issues besides familial hypocholesterolemia. The story of how I figured this out is pretty funny. One day I had a negative/allergic reaction to a food I never tried before or it might've been a new skin product I was using (I'm still not sure), which is pretty common for me because my body and skin is very very very sensitive to new foods/products, and my face puffed up a little and my cheeks were very red/itchy, and coincidentally I had a mandatory routine doctor's checkup I needed for school because I had just turned 18 at the time. My family doctor wasn't available so I went to this random doctor because I was on a time crunch, and she was super concerned about my face and I told her that that's just my skin and it's very sensitive (I've had allergy tests before but we never figured out what causes me to get like this). But the doctor insisted (and I mean INSISTED) that I had Lupus even though I truly felt ok just a little itchy (plus I get eczema in the winter so I'm used to face rashes and such). 

Anyway, the whole Lupus thing freaked out my mom and she listened to that doctor's suggestion that I get my blood tested at my usual family doctor's. I was negative for Lupus, which I knew would happen. But surprisingly, my LDL cholesterol was through the roof. I'm talking about levels over 300. It was bad, but considering how healthy I eat and how active I am and how young I am, my doctor said not to worry too much, it's genetic high cholesterol and even though I can't cure it, I can keep it under control with statins (which I still take and will have to take forever). It makes sense because both my parents have high cholesterol and both of my siblings have it too so I shouldn't have been surprised. A few months later, I got more blood work done too see how I'm doing. The statins are working perfectly, all my cholesterol is in check. I had elevated liver enzymes, which was most likely due to the high cholesterol, but I got an ultrasound of all my organs just to make sure my liver is ok. After that, I got a clean bill of health. 

Sorry for that long description I just wanted you all to have a back story of my medical history. About a month ago, I got sick. I'm in college and EVERYONE was so sick and germy and I tried to avoid it but I still ended up with laryngitis. I tried to go to my regular family doc but she was too busy (my clinic sucks sometimes, I know). So, I had to go to some other random doctor. He asked for my medical history and stuff and he checked my throat, and did other regular checks. When he listened to my chest, however, he said I had a heart murmur. He said that some murmurs are harmless but some can be serious. He asked if I ever have fainting spells, and I don't so he said probably not to worry too much.  I got some antibiotics and some cough meds for my laryngitis and I was out the door. 

I did some research about heart murmurs. Most of what I read pertains to older people over like 45 years of age, so for the most part I think I'm fine. But when I read some of the symptoms (don't judge me, i was curious), i felt like a have a few. One of the major things Im worried about that I wasn't really worried about before is that sometimes when I'm in a stationary position for too long or I get up too suddenly, I loose feeling in the left side of my body. Mostly the face and arm. It kinda feels numb but then I'm back to normal in a few seconds, so I never really think twice of it. Also, although I have never fainted, sometimes when I get up too quickly, I feel a little dizzy, which can be the heart murmur thing but I've mostly thought it was that I'm dehydrated, since sometimes i have the bad habit of not drinking enough water. Other than that, I feel fine. The thing is, no other doctor in my 19 years of life has ever mentioned hearing a murmur, and I've had many doctor checkups. Maybe that one doctor misheard something or maybe there is something serious going on with my heart. I told you my medical history so maybe I can get insight from others about their opinions. I'm not sure what the next steps for me would be. Any thoughts? ",2016-11-23 04:24:12+00:00,"[""I was unlucky enough to have the harmful kind of heart murmur. I'm not a doctor at all but I did learned that a trained doctor can easily guess what's the cause of a heart murmur simply by listening to it. In my case, it was too loud to ignore so, they sent me to a cardiologist. I then had an echo cardiogram to confirm what the doctor had in mind. It was a leaking mitral valve and it was leaking massively so they were quick to schedule a surgery. They couldn't wait anymore than a few months for the surgery. At least, I was lucky enough to have a great surgeon who did a perfect repair job. He did an open heart surgery through a small incision on my right side. \n\nAn echo-cardiogram is usually enough to see if there's trouble with a heart valve.""]",551

I'm 20 years old. Female. Normal weight. No family history of heart diseases. So basically, a DR. is not gonna look very hard for a heart related problem. It's been a year with no progress, only worsening symptoms, and it's gotten to the point where i literally cannot function. I cannot enjoy anything in life. I am uncomfortable and feel weak, fatigued and depressed constantly. I cant even stand up and talk without feeling short of breath.

Today I went to the cardiologist, an appointment i waited 3 months for, and they did a regular ekg and a stress test ekg. Both looked normal. My heart rate went up pretty high during the stress test which involved me walking fast and then running at an incline for 10 mins, and I am out of shape, so that's not surprising. What IS worrisome is that afterwards i felt literally so dizzy, nauseous, just like... death. I told myself that everything was gonna be ok and that i'm just really out of shape and these feelings would subside with rest. Well it's been 8 hours and my throat still tingles, feels tight, my chest feels tight, feels like i have trouble getting breaths in and out and i'm just sitting, resting. My upper left shoulder is INSANELY sore, as if i just worked it out like crazy, and all i did was walk and jog for a few minutes. My left side of my jaw as well as my teeth tingle and feels like there's nerve pain sort of. My vision has gone a little funny on and off today, like when I try to focus and read text on a screen.

I know what many of you will say: Anxiety. ""You're 20, with no family history, you're fine."" Okay, yeah, i've heard that about a million times, been prescribed tons of anxiety meds, havent felt anxious or panicky in over 6 months now, tried to rationalize everything and tell myself anxiety but let me tell you, even when I am high off my ass on anxiety meds, I still have the same symptoms. Only difference is i'm too high to care. 

I've been to the ER like 10 or more times in a year, each time they just basically tell me i'm not currently dying because my ekg looks okay. But i have done my research, and I know that, particularly in women, an ekg alone is not enough to discover a heart condition. I know it sounds paranoid, but what would you do if you were basically the perfect candidate for being ignored, yet your symptoms got to the point of being unable to function, but you're told you're fine? I mean, I have every hallmark symptom. There are things that it could be. It could be coronary microvascular disease, for example. Or a less than 70% blockage, undetectable on an ekg.

I need advice. I need to know someone else has experienced something like this and was able to get all the proper diagnostics done. I mean i know that women, particularly young women, are not generally thought of to be at high risk, and with negative test results, further testing is going to be hard to get, but If i was male, and still symptomatic, statistics show they would look harder... so what can i do? Just wait and hope I don't have a heart attack someday? Or is there some method of advocating I can do for myself? Can I demand specific tests? Is there a foundation for cardiologists who specialize in women's hearts?

I am in so much pain right now I know that was probably just an insane jumble of words so forgive me... I'll probably go through and proof read but I just need to get this out there... I am desperate for some kind of hope, advice, anything...",2016-10-12 05:52:01+00:00,"[""I'm kind of in the same boat except that I finally found an answer after so many years. It started early in my teenage years but, every doctors I saw told me it was anxiety. One stupid doctor even asked me if I was hearing voices. I've taken Paxil for a long time too. Then, in April, I saw a doctor for a totally unrelated symptom (blood in urine caused by kidney stone). She used her stethoscope to listen to my heart and she heard a big murmur so she did what she could to get me to consult a cardiologist ASAP. \n\nThe cardiologist saw nothing wrong on the ECG but since the murmur was still there, he did an echo cardiogram and he found the culprit. I had a mitral valve prolapse with massive regurgitation and I needed surgery to repair it. I was born with that default but it got worse as I grew older. \n\nI had to wait 6 months for the surgery. That's what you get in Quebec with publicly subsidized healthcare. You don't have to get in debt for treatment but, sometimes it can be long. Anyway, on October 26th I finally got the surgery and now, I'm at home recovering from it. It's not like a magic wand, I need to exercise to make sure my heart get strong again and I'm slowly gaining energy every-day. But: the greatest news is that those alarming palpitations are gone and I don't feel as tired as I did everyday.\n\nWaiting for a heart surgery was a big source of anxiety but it wasn't that bad after all. They were able to do it via heartport access. Which means, they didn't have to cut through my sternum so I don't have any broken bone. They simply used a camera and inserted it between my ribs on my right side. It still is an open heart surgery but it's less invasive.\n\nIn your case, maybe you could get a Holter too, it's a device which you wear like a cellphone for 24-48 hours. It will record continuously the electrical activity of your heart while you're doing your normal daily chores. Then, they analyze afterward and look for anomalies "", ""If they won't diagnose you with heart disease because you're young and female, can you get diagnosed with a related disease?  Look into diabetes and fibromyalgia and see if the symptoms sound like what you're experiencing.\n\nIt sounds like you have some sort of inflammatory disease.  I think the best way to fight inflammation is fix whatever is causing the inflammation, but there are other options.  You could improve your diet by eating fresher, less processed foods and avoiding refined sugar and gluten.  Gluten is thought by many to cause inflammation even if you're not allergic, by damaging the lining of the gut and allowing undigested food into the bloodstream.  The gluten thing isn't proven though as far as I know.\n\nThere are also nutritional supplements you can take that help with inflammation.  I think most multivitamins are pretty useless because companies put in the cheapest ingredients available and those usually aren't well absorbed in the body.  I have found some supplements that contain good quality ingredients that are proven to work in peer-reviewed studies.

He has gone from primary care to ENT to neurologist.  Initial diagnosis was VBI, after performing the VBI balance test where he put his hands out and almost fell over from the pressure on his hands and inability to balance.  This was in alignment with his symptoms of his fellow tennis players saying he started to look a bit drunk chasing balls on the court.

He had an MRI of the Brain and and MRI of the Neck, and the arteries seemed clear from those pictures according to the interpreter.  They found a 3mm aneurysm in his brain, but said he could have had that his whole life, and the attending doctor said nobody is going to do anything until the aneurysm reaches 5-7mm.

My question is - I thought that if there was a risk of a carotid artery being blocked, a Coronary Artery CT Scan would be better than an MRI to show whether the artery is blocked or not?  Is the conclusion from an MRI like a functional MRI where they measure oxygen flow and use normal ranges to deduce whether the oxygen flow is normal and that's what they're using to say the MRI came back normal?

However, I asked to go to a specialist because of these breathing problems which I can describe like this: I have no feeling of suffocation or my soul falls out after some shorter activities, I can run on the 5th floor without any problems I need a minute for my breathing to return to normal , however, it happens to me that after climbing 10 steps I feel like I need one or two deeper breaths to normalize everything again. The specialist told me that I have no suspicious sounds and that these problems can be caused by the stomach (because I have some gas, some discomfort in the stomach) but it can also cause a rapid pulse, which I will focus on below. I did a spirometry which showed that my lung capacity was excellent, but that there were indications for developing bronchitis or asthma, but mostly good results, to note that I did not have any cough,and i still dont have it. As for my heart rate,  What I have noticed when I climb those 10 steps is that my deeper breathing causes by rapid pulse , and even more so, I start to notice that any of my activities that I thought that is breathing problem. it is actually the pulse that recovers more slowly so to speak. I run 100 steps and it takes me about 45-60 seconds for my breathing to return to normal, but my pulse is still working harder so it makes my breathing go a little deeper.

My question is if I should purchase a blood pressure monitor in order to track this over time.

As I am relatively young, I would like to know if it makes sense to put in the time and the money to purchase one. The doctor never suggested I do so, we never talked about this.

The most common cardiovascular disease is [coronary artery disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613). According to the American Heart Association, around 15,500,000 people in the United States are affected by it.

It is usually brought about by atherosclerosis, a recurring condition wherein the walls of the arteries get blocked by deposits of fat called “plaque”, resulting in an obstructed flow of blood.

The coronary arteries supply blood, oxygen and nutrients to your heart. A buildup of plaque can narrow these arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. Eventually, the reduced blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.

Some commonly documented causes are:

* Smoking
* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes or insulin resistance
* Not being active (sedentary lifestyle)

Luckily almost all of these are able to be mitigated by a healthy lifestyle. Here are some tips we have found: [https://discourse.medecio.com/t/tips-for-living-with-coronary-artery-disease/193](https://discourse.medecio.com/t/tips-for-living-with-coronary-artery-disease/193?u=ishanbansal)

I smoke and drink, both bad habits I know. I'm a bit overweight but plan on working on that and have been taking some small steps already.

I've went to A&E twice and had EKG's there and they seemed normal, I went once after consuming some alcohol and noticed my heart rate was up to 172 at one point so got checked out but I had normalised after relaxing in the waiting room, they said I seemed fine on the basis of the EKG but wanted to do some blood tests, as the wait time was over 5 hours I didn't stick around, the same situation the second time, except I wasn't drinking, I actually went after college. 

I then had a visit with my GP, to get it checked out who once again said I seemed fine and didn't seem to display signs of just randomly having a heart attack, he did put me on a list to see a cardiologist but I'll likely be waiting several years for that.

I do have anxiety that can range from mild to severe depending on my state of mind. My family on my father's side has had a history of heart problems and dying as a result of heart problems and heart attacks and one that I know on my mother's side as well had had bypass surgery. 

I just assumed because of my age that If I turned things around in my 20s I'd be okay.

Between 21-23 I also partook in some recreational MDMA and Cocaine use, I no longer have an interest in them. 

My heart rate today hasn't went above the 70s which is good, sometimes though I'll be sitting there and notice It's in the 120s and have a tight or burning sensation in my chest, occasionally even electric shock kinda feelings around my waist area.

Here's my story. In July of 2019 I got sick. I started having episodes of lightheadedness, tachycardia, sweats, tremors, brain fog, vomiting, extreme fatigue, heat and steam intolerance, and exercise intolerance. After a number of tests (MRI, many EKGs, cardiac event monitor, echocardiogram, and more) I was referred to a cardiologist who diagnosed me with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). The cardiologist listened to my symptoms and took my orthostatic blood pressure and prescribed me midodrine to help raise my blood pressure. He never ordered a tilt table test.

Fast forward to earlier this month. After finally getting Medicaid after losing my job due to my condition in October, I decided to get a second opinion from a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic (luckily very close to me). I saw a neurologist who specialized in POTS. He immediately ordered a tilt table test and autonomic testing. I got the results back yesterday and it turns out the results were negative and I do NOT have POTS. The cardiologist who read my tilt table test reached out to my doctor about QT prolongation. Essentially he is concerned that my heart may take longer than normal to recharge between beats. 

I did some research and it does look like QT prolongation could explain a lot of my symptoms. I also see that some medications can cause it. I do take citalopram (celexa) and hydroxyzine for panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. I read that citalopram can lead to QT prolongation and I already take the maximum dosage of 40mg per day. I have been on citalopram for almost 10 years, but did have my dosage upped from 20 to 40mg in November of 2018. I began taking hydroxyzine in November of 2018 as well. I also take claritin and am still on midodrine for the moment. 

I have an appointment with an electrophysicist at the Cleveland Clinic, but they can't get me in until late April. I'm concerned that my condition could worsen in the meantime, especially if it is being caused by the medications I take. I have read that in some cases, QT prolongation can lead to cardiac arrest. 

Whatever this illness is, it has really taken a toll on my life. I lost my job, can't shower while standing, often times can't drive, and almost any physical activity triggers an episode. Half the time I can't think straight because of the brain fog. 

If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this, please let me know.

687,Help Managing Chronic Diseases,1,e6kwbm,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/e6kwbm/help_managing_chronic_diseases/,1,"As part of a student project for Miami University’s Farmer School of Business, in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, my fellow classmates and I are researching possible solutions for managing chronic diseases in the home healthcare setting.

Chronic diseases are those that persist for an extended period of time and cannot be cured by medication alone. These diseases are a serious issue; especially for the elderly. 80% of adults over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition. Some examples of chronic diseases include heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Heart disease alone claims over 600,000 lives each year.

It is extremely difficult to manage chronic diseases. Patients must adhere to challenging regiments of medication, diet, and  exercise. Not to mention they must monitor themselves regularly. Therefore, we believe a digital solution for managing chronic diseases could be of great benefit for those suffering from them.

My team has created a in-home digital solution to assist patients with chronic diseases with tracking the necessary steps to be healthy. Our idea is to create a portable tablet system that will be able to create schedules for exercising, assist with medication schedules as well as request refills automatically, and provide patients with access to valuable health information resources. The device will also be able to contact your doctor or emergency services along with  facilitating “Evisits” that allow you to have an appointment with your doctor remotely over the internet. We have also incorporated smart speakers that could engage with the patient and perform tasks via voice commands. Any smart speakers would be wireless connected to the home-base system.

We plan to create wireless attachments like an EKG monitor and blood pressure monitor for patients with specific chronic conditions like heart disease. There is the possibility to incorporate various wearable attachments for specific needs of each patient.

We are looking to gain feedback on what is good, bad, and what you would change from people with chronic conditions. If you or someone you know has a chronic condition, **kindly tell us your thoughts of this solution and how do you feel it would impact you as a person with a chronic condition**? We also would accept general feedback from those without a chronic illness.

Hello,
Twice this week, I had severe shortness of breath for a few seconds. It didn't happen overtime, it was like my airway instantly turned into a straw, breathing was almost impossible. I am 31 years old woman with no history of known serious disease. My family has no history of cardiac sudden death history, my family or I don't have asthma. It's been a very stressful couple of weeks for me so I considered panic attack however it lasted only for a few seconds and my airway blockage really felt real- I actually heard my wheezing. Time to time, I also had mild pain and numbness on my left arm, shoulder and chest for the last 2-3 months but it didn’t feel like anything serious. I am planing to pay a visit to a cardiologist however I am currently in a country where I don't know the native language so if I have to undergo lots of procedures, it will be really hard for me to apply, do the tests, arrange things with insurance etc. I know it's my health and I will try to visit the doctor office as soon as possible but I am still waiting for my health insurance card. 
In the meantime, I'd appreciate if you shared your experiences, thoughts, suggestions on this.

The family doc will probably take some blood work and have you use a 24hr heart monitor to see if you have any irregular rhythms and things of that nature. It is most likely stress and anxiety, I see it alot at my ER where someone comes in saying they are having a heart attack and it turns out they are just having a panic attack.

I know reddit isn't a place to diagnose myself, but the earliest appointment I could get with a cardio is mid-october.

 I'm 18 years old and for the past year had a problem abusing Adderall, nicotine (vape), and did ecstasy a few times. About a month ago I went on an adderall binge and one night experienced symptoms of a heart attack (palpitations, chest pain, tightness in left side). Went to urgent care and ran an EKG, doc found left atrial enlargement and said my symptoms were caused by my heart being put under heavy stress for a prolonged time. I wasn't allowed to exercise or have caffeine for about a week.

Went back a week later, EKG turned out normal. Doctor cleared me and said my heart recovered and was normal again. Afterwards, I would have occasional symptoms like jaw/left arm pain or palpitations, but otherwise I was fine.

Fast forward to 2 weeks later--I was cleaning my floors when I suddenly started to feel lightheaded and out of it, like I was on the brink of fainting. If I laid down in bed, I would feel fine again but as soon as I was sitting or standing, I would feel like collapsing. I rushed to urgent care again and ran another EKG, which came back normal again and the doc told me I'm just wasting my money on tests at this point. 

But ever since that day, which happened 4 days ago, I've felt so fatigued and lightheaded all day, even when I'm not exercising. The only way to feel normal again is by lying down. I feel extra lightheaded after exercise though, even as mild as shooting around a basketball. It just concerns me that everything feels like a daze and my sensations are numbed unless I lay down in bed or my car seat. I researched POTS but that seems more like a condition that lasts for a few minutes after standing up, not for an indefinite time. 

Finally, I have a chest sensation that's **not exactly pain**, but more like something touching the skin of my chest. If I'm shirtless, my chest feels like it has a shirt over it or wrapped around. But it's not the same type of pain I experienced during the adderall phase. And to clarify, I drink plenty of fluids and am eating fine.

My question is, has anyone experienced any of the sensations I described? Or based on your knowledge, do you think I could have a serious heart problem? I have a cardio appointment in a month and a half but I'm worried things could get worse before then. Any advice or input is appreciated, thank you!

tldr: had heart problems from adderall abuse, got better and was cleared by doctor, started recently feeling lightheaded 24/7 and chest has a weird sensation of something wrapped on the skin (not pain). any knowledge/possible conditions?",2019-09-01 02:00:00+00:00,['How do you feel today?'],700

I tried to keep this short but wanted to give as much relevant information as I could.  I'm desperate for any answers to help my mother. I'm hoping to find any way to relieve her discomfort or at least have an idea of what's happening to better communicate with the doctors because some have been very dismissive. We are seeing a specialist in 2 weeks again to hopefully have something more concrete.

&#x200B;

**About the patient:** She is not overweight, does not have high cholesterol, never smoked and doesn't drink. She's in her early 70s.  She's had radiation laser therapy for some nodule in one of her lungs years ago. Recently diagnosed with Parkinson's.

&#x200B;

**Symptoms:**  Very light activity leads to her heart feeling weak/overworked/palpitations/ a fast heart rate.  No pain, but it's a discomfort rated 7 out of 10, though it varies dramatically. Even bed-rest all day is no longer helping and the feeling comes and goes throughout the day.

&#x200B;

**Back story/when it began:**

First symptom started around 2 years ago and gradually worsened over time.

In 2017, it started with her heart feeling unwell after walking around the grocery store. She used to be a very active senior prior to this.  Currently, it's to the point where simple activity such as walking to the kitchen or standing for too long will overwork her heart.  It just seems like her heart is slowly giving out and I'm so frustrated that not a single doctor could tell us why or give us a diagnosis... 

Last night we took her to the ER - one of several trips in the past year - because her symptoms would not abate. 

&#x200B;

**Last night's ER evaluation:** pressure was high, but it calmed down soon after.  EKG was normal. 

&#x200B;

**Doctor and previous ER evaluations:** EKGs were mostly normal. Some palpitations detected. They don't have an answer for her. She has an echocardiogram in 2 weeks. She's had one in the past but I wasn't around at the time. From my understanding, they didn't give her any diagnosis or it was inconclusive.

&#x200B;

Her case is strange to me because her heart issues started exactly when she also started having mobility issues/losing strength.

**Other symptoms that started at the same time:**  loss of balance, hand tremors, overall muscle weakness.  She was ""officially"" diagnosed with parkinson's in regards to these symptoms.

From my understanding, heart issues are not typically connected with Parkinson's, but I can't help feel it's connected somehow.

\-------

Apologies for redundancies or if this reads very robotically. I'm tired and wanted to type this up quickly.

The echocardiogram can't come soon enough. I feel so hopeless. 

I'm not expecting a miracle and accept the situation, as does she and we're preparing emotionally for what may come. But if there's any chance someone here could give us some semblance of an idea, it would mean so much to me.

I am very active because of my job and I walk my dog all the time but I don’t “exercise” I am making this post because I want your guys opinion on my situation. The past 8 or so years I’ve had extremely high blood pressure. I’m talking consistently above 150 over 100 readings usually higher than that. Like an idiot I waited till a few months ago to get on blood pressure medicine.  I am thankfully only on two medicines which appears to have lowered it substantially. Even tho sometimes I will get readings that are 140 over 90 but that’s about as high as it gets now.  I feel like I have done huge damage to my heart by waiting this long to get on blood pressure medicine and I’m super worried about it. I have gained 50 pounds over the last 8 years but my blood pressure was really high even when I was skinny. I used to smoke cigarettes but only for about a year or so. 

On to why I’m worried.  First of all I barely have the money to see a primary care provider to get my blood pressure medicine because my insurance it’s not the greatest.  So I probably won’t end up going to a cardiologist. I fear that I have a heart issue that is getting worse and worse because of certain symptoms. I get lightheaded all the time. Like when you stand up really fast but it happens to me even when I just stretch for a second. My vision gets starry and sometimes I feel like I’m going to pass out. It’s honestly kind of a pleasant feeling oddly enough. Also I am extremely tired all the time even tho I get tons of sleep. Too much sleep actually.  And if I don’t get a good amount of sleep I get super grumpy.  Sometimes I get out of breath just walking up stairs although I’ve had asthma my whole life so it could be because of that. A lot of times I will wake up and my whole body will be numb but sometimes it is just my left arm that goes numb. 

So yeah if you made it thru this whole post thank you. I just had to get this off my chest (pun intended) because it’s been worrying me. Another thing to note is that I actually had an ultrasound done on my heart when I was 14 because the doctor was concerned about my elevated blood pressure even tho I was young and very fit at he time.

Do not eat out more than once or twice a week. Bag your own lunches. Cook at home. Restaurants & fast food will slowly kill you.\n2. Eliminate oil as much as possible from your diet. Even olive oil. It\'s the world\'s highest calorie density food. It causes inflammation in your arteries. Almost all olive oil is adulterated & rancid. Oils are deodorized to hide the rancidity.\n3. Minimize processed food snacks and sugary treats to a few times a week. Learn to enjoy fresh fruit, a small amount of nuts, toast & sugar-free jam.\n4. Do not drink soda- doesn\'t matter if it is sugar free or not. No fruit juices either. Drink water, tea, coffee... if you crave something with bubbles, go for carbonated mineral water- you can add some lime for flavor. Oat milk works great for coffee.\n5. Minimize dairy, eggs, & meats. Before I had my heart attack, I every single damn meal had one or more of the above. Try to limit it to once a day. Then, if you\'re motivated, try once every other day... and keep extending the time until you no longer feel the cravings for these. Cheese will be a real challenge for you. It is extremely addictive- it\'s been clinically proven to be more addictive than cocaine- I\'m not joking. Dairy has something in it meant to make calves crave it so they don\'t starve.\n6. Avoid vegan meat, dairy, egg substitutes. They are full of oils. The nut milks are OK, but they also contain small amounts of oil. I have oat milk just for coffee and almond milk for the occasional bowl of cereal.\n\nAs it stands, I believe you\'re at risk for not only heart disease, but diabetes as well.

https://preview.redd.it/f7benc5pjg521.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a2410d0226f78763c178f816faf8b126564a46e

Christmas is a time of family, happiness, and joy. It is a day to relax, share love and exchange gifts with our friends and family, wishing each other success in the upcoming year. It is indeed a shining moment when we gather around the Christmas tree to open our presents. Besides gifts, a Christmas feast is an inevitable part of the celebration. We enjoy eggnog, canapes, chicken wings, cinnamon rolls, and all the other dishes that make this day special. It all seems magical. It feels like nothing can go wrong. But if we tell you that the day after Christmas is a day with the most heart attacks recorded of all the year, you wouldn’t be so quick to grab another piece of pie, would you?

**People Tend to Be Less Responsible During Holidays**

All this relaxation can turn into carelessness and can be costly, especially for older people and those with heart problems. Think about it this way: if you have cholesterol problems, you are probably disgusted with all the medications, recommended diets and other pieces of advice your doctor has given you over the years. It’s Christmas! You want to celebrate, relax, and forget about all that stuff. You want to have a few drinks with your friends, talk with them, and enjoy all the festivities the day has to bring.

Unfortunately, the illness doesn’t care about the holidays. Something that you would describe as giving yourself a little break, doctors call signing a death sentence. The change in your habits during the holidays can cause severe problems. Because of all this excitement, [you probably forgot to go to the gym](https://www.myfooddiary.com/blog/4-reasons-to-keep-exercising-during-the-holidays), or if it’s cold outside, you maybe didn’t even leave the house. You drank more alcohol than usual, and you certainly ate a lot more than you should have. Your heart is challenged to surpass all these unexpected obstacles, and very often, it can’t. The consequences can be fatal. 

**How Can You Prevent Unwanted Events?**

You should pay extra attention to a few details so you can enjoy your Christmas while not putting your health in jeopardy. First of all, [try to have a light breakfast](https://cholesterade.com/blog/four-on-the-go-snacks-to-help-lower-blood-glucose-and-cholesterol/). Some oatmeal combined with fresh fruit would be a great choice. For your lunch, sneak some garlic, avocados, salmon or walnuts onto your plate. These foods lower the cholesterol in your blood, and they will help you make a healthy balanced Christmas menu. Remember, it is important to be moderate in both eating and drinking.

It is OK to have a drink or two, but don't go too far. Have a glass of water between drinks and stop before you start feeling tipsy. Adding a food supplement during holidays is not a bad idea, either. Cholesterade is an excellent choice since it reduces bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol. It is 100 percent natural, and it tastes good too. 

The tips above are pretty much essential for your health not only during Christmas but throughout the whole year. Try to be responsible, enjoy, relax, but don’t do something regretful. It will make your holidays even more enjoyable. ",2018-12-20 16:17:09+00:00,"[""Seriously ? I'm not a doctor but one meal can't make you have an heart attack. This isn't how heart diseases work.

Before that, I've had so many other surgeries and procedures that I couldn't possibly list them all here. I was basically supposed to never make it out of the hospital after I was born because of how severe the disease was, but here I am, still kicking.

&#x200B;

Now, for the problem. (Please read, I know it's long.)

&#x200B;

About a month ago, the left side of my chest and back suddenly started aching - like a muscular ache so I didn't think anything of it because I've had muscular aches before. Then, I noticed I was reaching for my inhaler (given to me because my breathing always goes to shit in the colder months) multiple times a day because my chest felt so tight. I went to the emergency room twice in the past month, and each time had the same tests -- echocardiogram, x-ray, CT scan, a metric crap ton of bloodwork, ECGs -- nothing was found to be out of the ordinary or any different than my heart looked a year ago post surgery.

&#x200B;

So fast forward to now, a month later. I still have this constant ""ache"" in the left side of my chest and back, and can occasionally feel it in my arm as well. Occasional shortness of breath, but it seems to come out of nowhere (like, I'll suddenly feel like I need to sit up and take deep breaths when I'm laying in bed at night, but then I'll feel fine when I go for a jog around the block). I've been trying to get in to see my cardiologist, but the cardiologist I see is only at my local office once a month. He insists that I'm fine and that I need to not stress so much because all of my tests have come back fine and having all of this pain for a month now, it's unlikely to be anything major because I would've dropped dead or at least passed out by this point.

&#x200B;

I'm not satisfied with the answer. I don't know what to do. I've been to my primary care doctor who also isn't concerned because nothing screams that my heart is in any danger, but she can't tell me why I'm experiencing this pain either. I have an appointment with a GI doctor in a week because we all seem to think the constant pain is related to my GERD at this point, but it just doesn't feel like it is. I'm worried sick to the point that I'm afraid to go to sleep at night because I'm worried I won't wake up, and at this point, I'm also scared to go to a ""new"" cardiologist because I have 26 years worth of very extensive cardiac surgeries and procedures that my current cardiologist presumably knows very well inside and out.

Never had it before. I have acid reflux and asthma, and chronically clear my throat/cough almost unconsciously. Following the double IHB symbol, I retook my BP several times, making a specific effort to sit absolutely still and not clear my throat or cough on some of the readings, and deliberately coughing/clearing my throat on others. Sure enough, the “sitting still” readings were all IHB-less, and the ones where I coughed/cleared my throat all showed the symbol.

This seems to suggest that the IHB symbol was triggered simply by the vibrations from clearing my throat and coughing, but as a hypochondriac, I have to ask: is there some way that coughing hard can somehow trigger an extra or skipped heartbeat? Or am I safe in my assumption that the fidgeting and subtle movement from coughing/clearing triggered the symbol?

This is an extremely important topic because cardiac rehab is pertinent to patient success and recovery but there is a lack of access especially in rural and urban settings.  In addition, because there is a lack of access there are also increased costs for the program as a result many patients just do not participate in the program.  2008 MIPPA created the usage ""direct physician supervision"" and as a result medicare and medicaid will only change their policy if the terms direct physician supervision is changed as well.

792,Young afib patient,1,4gqzwr,HeartDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartDisease/comments/4gqzwr/young_afib_patient/,0,"Hello all,

Quick question. I have had afib for about a year. 3 episodes so far. They all trigger funny. First off my health status. I am all clear. 31 years old. Just lost 55 lbs over the course of two years. Fairly active now a days. Work out multiple times a week. I do have some anxiety issues that mess with my pulse a bit.

My first afib attack was after I woke up one day and bounced out of bed because I realized I was late. Lasted a few hours and then converted on my own. Ekg was clean by the time I got to the clinic. At this point I was only getting a few hours of sleep a night.

Second time was similar, went to bed at 1 am. Woke up at 3am. And got up out of bed and it started. Was kind of excited to... Have sex with my wife. I jumped up and it started right away.

Doctors caught that one before it converted and put me on beta blockers and aspirin. I wasn't too happy but agreed for three months to try it. I did fine for three months and came off.

That was about a month and a half ago. So this latest event was different. I was sick, barely ate on a Sunday and was super gassy. I decided I was going to fast on Monday. Sunday I ate a breakfast sandwich and barely ate anything the rest of the day. Monday I didn't eat and drank a little water. After 1pm and tired of sitting all day I decided to jump to the ground and do some intense push-ups. Started about half way thru. I caught myself holding my breath too. I confirmed I was in afib and went to lay down. I decided to try to stop it the way it usually starts. I crunched up and bounced out of bed. Rhythm normalized and then had a sharp cramp in my lower belly that was a gas bubble. Called the Dr and they called me back. Nurse didn't like that I hadn't really eaten in over 24 hours and even the days before either slipped because we went to a theme park even while sick and ate bad. She was convinced my potassium and electrolytes were low. I ate and have been fine since.

Yesterday I did 300 push ups and nothing. I really enjoy working out and don't want to lose this. It is the best shape I have been in in my life. All heart tests have been fine, Ekg, echo etc. Blood pressure is Avg 100/70. I have a feeling that this isn't a heart issue but is caused by digestion or gas. For the past few years I had been off and on with stomach issues. For a while I was in the bathroom minutes after eating. And also had bad acid reflux but I started taking some af beta food and knocked that out. That all has gotten better but I hadn't been gassy for months and months. The weekend I had bad gas and even my wife said something. Next day I had afib.

I just don't want to be tossed back on pills by my cardiologist as that was his first thing he did. My primary works with me more. I am still on the daily aspirin and I started taking magnesium supplements since I stopped the beta blockers. Has anyone else seen afib trigger from stomach issues? The nurse isn't worried and is convinced that I was malnourished.

I also think I am not getting enough food and good enough food lately since I have put on muscle. I also think my anxiety has a lot to do with my triggers. I have had unchecked anxiety until recently.

Not to make this any longer than needed I was paranoid for years over thinking I had diabetes, high blood pressure and other things I didn't. That all started when I was turning 30 so a lot of my issues I believe is mental. I had just relaxed about things and thing I triggered this afib attack and back to dwelling.",2016-04-27 22:30:22+00:00,[],793

I did an ecg, blood work, echo, and holter monitor back in July and all of them came back perfectly normal. Except the ecg where the doctor told me there was a very minor discrepancy that I didn’t need to worry about and was probably due to machine error.

Over the past few months my (19F, 5’7”, 130 lbs) bp, which has always sat around 115-120/80-85, has been gradually changing. Specifically, the systolic bp has been getting lower every week but diastolic is still around the same, and my bp today was 95/78.  I understand that home blood pressure cuffs are not perfect, but I had other people try it (they got normal results) and I also took my BP manually with a stethoscope and got very similar results. In the past compared to my BP at the dr office, it was also always extremely close. 

My resting heart rate hasn’t really changed (around 70 bpm) although I’ve noticed it skips beats a lot. When I stand up, it skyrockets to 160 and stays above 110 bpm for several minutes. I get extremely lightheaded and nearly faint. When I walk, my heart rate stays around 170, but can get as high as 190. I’ve always been very active and was a competitive swimmer for 14 years, so this is extremely abnormal for me. 

If I attempt any exercise (more vigorous than just walking) now, I INSTANTLY struggle to breathe, my chest hurts, and my body starts to go kind of numb like I’m about to pass out. 

No matter the amount of sleep I get, I feel absolutely drained all the time. 

Before my symptoms really started/got bad, I had an ECG done at a checkup. Results revealed: low QRS voltage (every lead), notched P wave (lead II), moderately deep negative P wave (V1), slight arrhythmia, and unspecified T wave abnormalities. 

I know googling symptoms is bad, but I knew a fair bit about this stuff from my uni classes. I have several ideas on what it could be, but wanted to know if anyone that has these thinks this sounds familiar??

-Mitral valve stenosis (got strep a lot as a kid, was SUPER sick w/ scarlet fever once. Got EXTREME “growing pains” after this, in hindsight could’ve been rheumatic fever?) 

-Aortic stenosis (bicuspid valve)

-POTS 

-Dilated cardiomyopathy 

Family history of heart disease is all ischemic and occurring at much later age. 

Don’t know if any of this is relevant, but my medical history includes: chronic migraines, ADHD, positive TPO antibodies (thyroid autoimmunity- I have a family history of Hashimotos however all my thyroid hormones are currently normal), familial high cholesterol (even with a pretty healthy diet and exercise, mild enough to not be on statins yet). 

Probably a relevant factor, I started taking Adderall for adhd about a month after the symptoms started. Sumptoms were still very mild at this point so I didn’t think much of it. If I did indeed have an underlying heart issue, could Adderall have caused it to get worse faster?

Found on the world wide web! Check this out.

The Oxidized Cholesterol Strategy is a step-by-step guide that will teach you a natural alternative to mainstream cholesterol meds. Scott claims this will completely unclog your arteries, lower your cholesterol to a healthy level, and make you physically and mentally energized.

What is oxidized cholesterol? Why is it bad for your health?

It is produced when normal LDL cholesterol is destroyed due to chemical interactions with free radicals, which are unstable molecules that damages body cells. When this happens, the oxidized cholesterol dangerously accumulates on your artery walls. The problem is your body’s natural defenses will misidentify oxidized cholesterol for bacteria, causing inflammation of the arterial walls. This then leads to heart attacks, strokes, and even death.

So, if mainstream cholesterol meds are not the solution, what can you do to lower your cholesterol levels?

He discovered the solution from Oliver, his high school best buddy. Oliver and the celebrities, politicians, and successful businessmen he worked with would go on health retreats in Europe. During these retreats, doctors treat them by making small dietary and lifestyle changes. No pharmaceutical meds involved.

Some of the things you will discover in this program include:

**–** How to eliminate oxidized fats and substitute them with healthy sources of fats and good cholesterol.

**–** Tools necessary for managing and tracking your strategy to ensure your success with this program.

**–** Steps that will lead you toward dropping your oxidized cholesterol level and unclogging your arteries.

**–** A list of foods that can increase and decrease oxidized cholesterol, and a lot more…

I hope this helps!

I had some very strange symptoms related to my heart in 2020 such as palps, skipping beats, breathlessness and for a few months couldnt sleep lying down (had to sleep in a chair all night).  I visited 5 cardiologists over 10 months, each one performing basic tests such as ECG, stress test, ultra sound etc with each one telling me my heart is fine and I should quit coffee.  Finaly I insisted on an echocardiogram and a CT scan with one doctor and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease 75% and 25% stenosis in two arteries (not any of the main arteries). 

Since getting diagnosed I have changed up my diet and excersise daily (just 15KM on a bike around a park) and the symptoms have been much better.

One sympton that has me real scared for a year or so and will not go away however and is failing to be recognised by these doctors is what I think might be Afib, but i am not sure.  Basicly I will go through phases on and off with irregular beats.  I can go a couple months without having them, but then might go on a 2 or 3 week binge period where they happen several times daily.  When they do happen, it is usualy after eating regardless of what I eat, like litteraly midmeal they will start and it could be a plate of veggies or a heavy carb pasta meal.  They also happen at random times and more recently seem to happen an hour or so after falling asleep.  I will wake up with them and they might last 2 hours.

Obviously its hard to explain what they are like, but if you will humour me I will try to explain a 10 second example, broke down into 2 second chunks:

First 2 seconds - 4 strong beats

Next 2 seconds - 2 weak beats

Next 2 seconds - a normal beat and then a skip

Next 2 seconds - 3 faint beats

Next 2 seconds -  a skip and 2 strong beats

So it feels like a serious of strong, weak, fast, slow and skipped beats all thrown in together with no pattern.  Does that sound like it could possibly be afib to you guys?  They have been far worse for the last few weeks while I am weanign myself of Lexapro.

I have rushed to ER a few times over last year when it has been real bad and I was convinced i was dying.  They would hook me up to a vitals monitor and give me an ECG.  The ECG always comes back as normal and they tell me I am fine, despite the vitals machine graph looking VERY irregular and making wild beeps and I can feel my heart going wild inside.  Honestly, trust me when I say the docs here are just not great at all.  ER departments never have a cardiologist at night and they only ever put one doc in charge through the night who always seems to be very very young.

I appreciate this isnt the place to get a diagnosis but in your opinion guys does this sound like Afib to you?

BTW I am 48M and take 5mg bisoprolol, baby asprin and 40mg atorvastatin daily.",2021-10-08 23:30:45+00:00,[],839

It feels to muscular and to far left to be in my heart but I am still nervous. I jump alot so I stretch that area alt but I often get muscle pain in the same sort of area when exercising. Sometimes after I exercise. I remember after working out for 2 hours in school it came on and lasted for like 2 or 3 weeks. Its very on and off. I've read about doms but it come on in just one area during exercise for a year. I've had 4 different periods of this over the last year lasting an average of 2 or 3 weeks,2021-02-12 18:49:51+00:00,"['It’s probably rib cartilage.
