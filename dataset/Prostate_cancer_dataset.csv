3,My father passed away on January 9th from advanced prostate cancer.,28,m05rik,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/m05rik/my_father_passed_away_on_january_9th_from/,10,"What a past year folks.   My father lost his battle with prostate cancer on January 9th. It was a cold Saturday.  But first lets go back a bit.   Last February my stepmother (like a mother) had a stroke.This was completely unexpected as she is really healthy and has been taking care of my dad in his battle against evil cancer.   We thought she was going to die. She was basically in a coma and the prognosis was getting worse as days went on with her still asleep. Through a family connection we got her to Mt Sinai in NYC via medi-copter and with a more intensive team she was able to wake up  .  My dad was so so happy to see her open her eyes.  I will never forget that.   But then the the virus and lockdowns happened.  So none of us really could see my mother in her recovery till she was released home.  It was an intensive recovery and took a deep stressful toll on my father for next year. She got gradually better but had trouble speaking and walking.   But as she got better.. he got worse but tried his best and continued treatments.   Both of my parents being ill at the same time was extremely surreal and taxing.      On top of this my wife had been pregnant and in August, i had my first child. A boy. It was my fathers first blood grandson.  We had a few months where he could spend some time with him and I am grateful for that.. but bittersweet in the end.   Eventually my father got worse to the point where he couldnt walk. He needed help to the bathroom etc..    It was so hard and difficult but I am grateful for that time and closure we had.  A somber Christmas and new years came and went and on Saturday January 9th he passed away peacefully at home. He had just turned 64. I was by his side rubbing his head telling him to fall into Gods arms.  Now he is no longer suffering and in a much better place than this.  The point of this whole story is no matter what happens you will get through it. You have to.  Stay strong and know that even in the most stressful, hardest, saddest time of our lives there is a way through. Always.

4,"A cautionary tale about ""normal"" PSAs in young men - My story as a 39yo with Gleason 9.",28,n4vh6e,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/n4vh6e/a_cautionary_tale_about_normal_psas_in_young_men/,27,"I’ve been meaning to write this for a while, both as a follow up on my [previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/m3tr4c/39m_just_got_mri_results_pirads_5_but_low_psa/) and at the request of a wonderful user here who suggested I share it to illustrate the dangers of trusting “normal” PSA results. I apologize if it gets lengthy.

For starters, I’m 39, healthy, normal BMI, no significant health problems of any kind. Virtually no family history of cancer of any kind.

Late last summer I began having a small amount of blood at the beginning of my urine stream. It would happen for 24-36 hours and I’d have an episode of it every one to two weeks. No other symptoms, only the small amount of blood. So in early September I went to see my urologist who did a PSA which came back at 1.4, which I was told was “normal”. All other bloodwork and urinalysis was normal. The PA I saw did a DRE which revealed a nodule and he said he’d have the doctor look at it. So we also did a cystoscopy and a CT scan, both of which were unremarkable. I assumed this was the extent of the doctor “looking at it” and disregarded the nodule. Finding no cause of the bleeding they sent me to nephrology.

My nephrologist ordered an ultrasound, which was all normal except for noting the nodule on my prostate. They asked me about it, I said “well, I was just at urology and they noted it but don’t seem concerned.” Bloodwork and urinalysis at this appointment was also all normal. They sent me home with a specimen cup to try to catch it in action.

So a few months go by with the same periodic mild bleeding. I’m starting to think this is just going to be my new normal since the docs hadn’t found anything wrong with me. Then come mid February I had an episode of significantly increased bleeding. I was passing a blood clot with every urination, the bowl was pink, etc. I captured a sample of this with the sample cup and brought it in. Besides the obvious presence of blood, it tested positive for some kind of strep so I was put on antibiotics. At the same time I went to see urology again. Once again, they performed a DRE, only this time the PA said “well if you were 90 I’d say you have prostate cancer” and ordered an MRI. Somewhere along the line here I had another PSA which was again in the 1.5 range.

The MRI was early March. I got a call from urology saying they found something and needed to do a biopsy. No surprise, I figured they’d find something so I wasn’t too worried….. Until a few days later on a Friday afternoon when my MRI report surfaced on my portal. PIRADS 5. Likely metastasis. Seminal vesicle involvement. Likely lymph node involvement. Oh shit. Don’t read MRI reports on a Friday afternoon, it’ll ruin your weekend.

The biopsy was the following Monday. The urologist made me feel quite a bit better about the MRI results, saying they sometimes look a lot worse than they are and then while doing the biopsy saying that it “looked like a lot of inflammation”. Hooray, I thought. So I felt pretty good for a few days until he called and said “do you have time to talk?” It was cancer. Gleason 9. And quite a bit of it. Ordered a bone scan - that was thankfully clean.

Following that news, I went to Mayo and talked to a great team there about the plan moving forward. As of now, I have an RP scheduled in a few weeks. The plan after that will vary depending on the pathology report.

But enough about me, the point of this whole story is really about PSAs. I had at least 3 done through this whole process and they were all around 1.5 and completely disregarded by my local urology team. As a matter of fact, the last time I was in there AFTER the diagnosis, the PA remarked about how strange my case is because my PSA is so “normal”. Well, it’s not. Now maybe my local urology team just sucks but reading other stories here I suspect there are plenty of other young guys with these mildly elevated PSAs not getting the testing they need. And I’m not writing this to freak out every guy here who’s young with a PSA over one. I figure my case is definitely more the exception than the rule. This is more a cautionary tale that if you’re a young guy with a PSA over one you should probably push for a little more investigation as apparently some of the medical community isn't taking this as seriously as they should. 

Anyway, that got plenty long. I hope it helps someone. If you have any questions or want to PM me, feel free. I'll answer pretty much anything.",2021-05-04 19:12:52+00:00,"[""Fortunately you are a very bright, intelligent and articulate guy, who went forward on treatment and didn't let it go any further.

Until last summer, when he started experiencing falls. And incomplete elimination. And urine that looked like sludge. Again, old age plus a history of arthritis (both knees were replaced 23 years ago) was blamed. Until his family doctor saw something on an x-Ray of his spine….but his PSAs were totally normal. Or when his liver enzymes and iron levels were astronomical. Only when he had a bladder infection that went septic about 3 weeks ago did they actually do a CAT scan and found what they were 99.9999% sure was prostate cancer metastasized to his bladder, spine, and lymph nodes.

I got diagnosed with prostate cancer as soon as I turned 40 from a routine physical and my first PSA test. I was told it was very minor numbers wise. I had the choice of removing the prostate, brachytherapy, or just monitoring psa numbers every 6 months. 

I wasn’t really concerned as the numbers were low and I was led to believe that this cancer caught early was easily curable. 

We sat on it and kept checking my PSA every 6 months. My numbers kept going up, not crazy or anything according to my specialist. After my second biopsy that showed nothing different I was told that sometimes a person can have cancer on the dither side of the prostate that can’t be seen without an MRI. 

I got an MRI scheduled, but since I’m in Canada and they didn’t think it was serious it turned out to be 18 months between getting told I needed one till actually getting it done. I never really thought it could be serious as why would they let me wait so long for the MRI?

Long story short I got the MRI and they found some aggressive cancer completely different from what we were monitoring. I had my prostate removed 2 months later. 

Biopsy showed that it has gone into my lymph nodes, this was last March. 

Since then I went to Montreal and paid for a pet scan that is in medical trials to see where it is actually at. I started hormone therapy in January, and am looking to do another injection in May and starting radiation treatment.

10,My journey with Prostate CA,21,nfpj4e,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/nfpj4e/my_journey_with_prostate_ca/,14,"Just posting my journey to anyone who can relate. 43 y/o here.

I've been doing blood work yearly just for health monitoring.

2019 PSA was around 9+. MD wasn't too concerned at that time as I was biking frequently. Waited a year to get blood again and stopped my biking.

2020 PSA was 7+. Referred to oncology. PSA again one month before biopsy still 7+ but lesser. Biopsy done on dec, confirmed stage 1 gleason 3+4 only on left side of prostate. Right side clean. Weighed my options to either RALP or conservative treatment. I wanted a one and done so opted the RALP and fast recovery.

I have been working out daily for 3 years now since I shoot competitively so the 4 months prior to surgery on 4/1/21, increased my cardio and low weights with high reps. Got covid on Jan so that didn't help but recovered fast by staying active and working out.

4/1 surgery went smooth. Didn't even need a JP drain. Cancer was confirmed that it was contained inside, no mets. Catheter in place for 8 days. 2nd post op day was hard, could barely move due to pain on post op site/area. 3rd day was better and started low weight lifts on 4th day and walking.

Morning erection started on 5th day and with the cath, the next 3 days was just an irritating experience. Cath was off on the 8th day and it was liberating.

Leak was expected. Started my slow runs on 2nd week and gradual progression while maintaining low weight lifts with high reps. On my first slow run, I felt something dropped inside me like my insides were settling down as during surgery, they tilt your upper body down to move your intestines upwards. It hasn't bothered me the rest of the week. Started doing isometric abdominal core exercises too and squats as my kegel exercise.

Kept my routine with gradual progression in basketball drills with full run but slow speed and weights on 3rd week. Still have to be conscious in controlling leak.

Started swimming on 4th week and was able to do butterfly with no problem. Leak still happens but to a lesser degree. Was able to travel with minor leak inconvenience.

5/4 MD said I can do whatever I want now with no lifting restrictions and was ok to return to work on 5/17 as my work requires heavy lifting when needed.

Went to a USPSA match on 5/16 and the only thing I noticed was my endurance with a half day of standing/sprinting was very low.

So glad my hard work on recover through exercise paid off. Leak is still there but very minute now. Can do a whole day with only 2-3 leaks, sometimes lesser.

Recovery from surgery is very good if your body is strong prior to surgery and you will benefit from it also after surgery as you can function better because you're not as weak.

Will consult with genetic testing for harmful variants as I'm very young to have this problem.

Update : 5/20 1st day didn't wear depends by accident as I haven't had any leak the last 2 days. Will continue to not wear depends and see how I do.",2021-05-18 23:23:38+00:00,"['Glad to hear this.

13,Darn! I have cancer,21,99u7oy,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/99u7oy/darn_i_have_cancer/,14,"**UPDATE:** Medical update: One of the 5 lymph nodes removed during surgery is positive for cancer, which means it has spread from the prostate. This means I need to go back on Hormone Therapy for 6 months (more hot flashes - oh boy) followed by directed radiation. Not the news I was hoping for, but not completely unexpected. If the cancer had been caught earlier, there was a good chance surgery was the end of it. So, guys, get your PSA checked.

**Darn! I have Cancer**

First, the bad news. I have cancer.

When I was told the news, my first reaction was anger. I was angry because I wasn’t negligent in my health. I wasn’t one of those guys who feared the doctor performing a prostate exam, and I had asked for a PSA exam (blood test for early diagnosis of prostate cancer) two years ago when I was 53.

Unfortunately, British Columbia has cut back on the type of exams they will cover, and my request for a PSA test was ignored. The province also frowns upon paying for an annual physical exam for men, which, if I’m being polite, is ridiculous.

When I turned 55 in May, I requested a physical exam from my doctor, including a PSA test. With no family history or other high-risk markers in my file, the doctor asked if I really needed the PSA. I answered that I would like to check it off my to-do list. When my PSA returned, I had a score of 24. Ideally, the score is meant to be below 3.

At first, my doctor and I convinced ourselves the score was an aberration or possibly a Urinary Tract Infection. I began antibiotics and took the PSA again. My score was 22.

I was sent to a urologist who did a more in-depth physical exam and found a lump. A biopsy was scheduled where the surgeon took 14 core samples from my prostate. All 14 came back with positive results for cancer. My Gleason score was 7, which is Intermediate/High Risk. An MRI followed, which brought more bad news. The entire prostate was compromised and the cancer was beginning to encroach upon the seminal vessels. Fortunately, the lymph nodes appear clear. A bone scan and chest X-ray also came back all clear.

My options are limited, but I’ve chosen an aggressive path. I started hormone treatment to stop the cancer growth in its track ,and I will be undergoing a radical prostatectomy in November. This leaves radiation on the table in case the surgery doesn’t catch it all. I remain optimistic. I believe the surgery has a good chance of rendering me cancer-free, and if not, I still have options.

My family is supportive and understands that this will be life-changing surgery. And that’s a key message: life changing, not life ending.

Some people aren’t so fortunate. So I’m officially a cancer patient, but I aim to become a cancer survivor in the very near future.

I also consider myself lucky. Not because of the cancer that has infected my physical carriage, but because of the life I have led. I never let fear get in my way of doing some wondrous things. I have written and published 10 novels, which would make my teenage self giggle with glee; I am married to the love of my life, and we have a kind, beautiful and wondrous daughter who makes me proud and happy every single day.

I was brave enough to make big changes in my life without regret, and fortunate enough to have loved ones who believed in me even when times appeared desperate. I followed my heart and it all worked out.

 If I am to impart any advice to those who may face cancer in their lives, I would say this: 

1. Men, get a PSA test. Insist on it if you must. The earlier this cancer is treated, the better your results.   

2. Drive a convertible. Even if you don’t have cancer, everyone deserves to own and drive a convertible. It makes you feel alive.  

3. Wear great shoes. Enough with the drab. Wear colorful, fancy, wonderful shoes. Embrace your individuality. Being part of the herd means you’re on auto-pilot. Go manual. If you want to skip to work, skip. If you want to ride a Segway, ride a Segway. Who cares what other people think. Be you because you are awesome.   

4. Don’t be a grump. Always remember that you don’t know what other people are going through, so don’t judge. Hell, they may have just found out they have cancer.   

5. Be kind. It’s a hard thing to teach, but if you treat people the way you would like to be treated, it’ll soon sink in. Empathy comes from understanding.   

6. Avoid jerks. Although this may seem counter-intuitive to No. 6, it really isn’t. Sometimes people are jerks, they’re human, but that is their problem, not yours. Walk away and let their bad day be their bad day.   

7. Count your blessings. Sure, this sounds corny, but it can also help you understand how rich your life truly is. When your child, spouse, friend, pet, houseplant perks up at your presence it’s because you bring light into their lives. Embrace this.   

8. Forgive yourself. There will be days when you’re not at your best, when you feel angry or sad. That’s okay. You don’t need to be perfect. It’s the flaws that make us who we are.   

9. Be selfish. If work/life isn’t going great and you feel your stress levels rising, skip out and go watch a fun movie by yourself. Buy the popcorn and/or Skittles and indulge in an afternoon flick when the theatre is mostly empty. Laugh or Whoop out loud and relish it. Life is too short for guilt.  

10.  Don’t be afraid of trying something new. You’re never too old to learn a new skill or do something that has always intrigued you. Age means nothing. If you want to go to Burning Man, go. If you want to get a tattoo, get it. If you want to dip your toes in that fountain, dip away. Life is for living, and so long as you’re not harming others, nothing is out of bounds.   

11. Be happy. Easier said than done at times, but know that it is possible. Life is very often ridiculous, even though we try to pretend it’s not. We can’t see around every corner or predict every turn in the road, but we can choose to experience happiness rather than dread or fear. Laugh at the ridiculous and find joy in the absurd. Make your laugh reverberate off the walls and leave its mark upon all who hear it. 

I have cancer. It’s annoying and frustrating and scary, but it doesn’t define me. Cancer is part of my journey. It’s not something that I thought I would ever face, but it’s here and I need to deal with it. I won’t always be brave. I may even shed a few tears, but you can bet I won’t go down without a fight. 

So for all those who have faced this journey, and for those who will face it in the future, I would like to say: “Screw You, Cancer! You may have snuck up on me, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to win.”",2018-08-24 03:55:34+00:00,"[""Amen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHang in there, man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know where you are in BC, but there will be a seminar coming up in September, the Pacific Northwest Prostate Cancer something or other.

Next step will be dealing with the lack of libido and the ED.  But I know from reading various materials that that can take a few years, so I'll have to be patient.

20,My journey with prostate cancer.,16,l83t69,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/l83t69/my_journey_with_prostate_cancer/,12,"Way back in 2016 I was 43 then, I was having issues with urination. Went to see my gp. Dre didn’t show anything, psa blood test was elevated. Repeated psa six weeks later and higher still. 

Was then referred to urologist, who repeated the psa, higher again. Sent for mri, which showed areas of concern. From there had a trus biopsy. Which came back stage 1, Gleason 6. This was now March 2017. We decided to follow active surveillance. Which involved regular blood tests, with annual mri. 
Early 2019, trus biopsy repeated with no changes. Psa remained high, but stable. 
Early 2020, the annual mri showed changes. Was sent for tppb biopsy, which although more thorough was quite a shock to the system. 
This showed my cancer had advanced and they recommended I look at treatment. 
As I’m a larger guy, the urologist recommended radiation. So I saw a radiation oncologist. He recommended surgery. Now what?
After much thought, research and discussions with the specialists I decided on radiation. For me it was a choice which I felt had less chance of life changing side effects. 

I’m now 2 treatments away from completing my radiation therapy. And I should be cancer free. 
The radiation has gone much better than I expected. Apart from no longer being ‘regular’ and getting very tired very quickly, I’ve had no issues. 
I live in New Zealand and this whole journey has cost me nothing. 
All the people I’ve dealt with have been kind compassionate and treated me with respect. 
I intend on my last day of radiation therapy to take a large cake and thank you card for the wonderful people looking after me. 

Yes this cancer can have a huge impact on your life. If you’re having urinary issues, go and see your doctor. So what if they have to do a dre, rather that and catch it early than too late.

I was diagnosed at the end of 2014, at the ripe old age of 47, stage 3a, gleason 8, PSA 67.   Same as you, I had urinary issues.   I was smart, went straight to the doctor, and got checked out.  Once those PSA numbers came back, well, that's when things started happening very quickly.\n\nStraight away, bone scan and MRI to see if there had been metastatic spread.  I thought I was a goner!   But turns out it was caught just in time, and there had been no spread, however the tumour had started to expand beyond the prostate.   Surgery wasn't an option due to the high numbers, so I was treated with three years of androgen deprivation therapy (bye bye testosterone!) with 37 external beam radiation treatments in the middle of all that.\n\nJust like you, it cost me nothing!  Did take some time getting used to being the youngest guy in the room whenever I went to the radiation suite though.\n\nAfter three years of treatment, PSA dropped from 68 to 0.05!   Once my testosterone levels rose again, my PSA rose slowly to stabilise between 0.6 and 0.8.  Best of all, MRI scans showed no visible tumours left in the prostate.\n\nI was extremely lucky.\n\nAlthough the hormones played havoc with my body for three years, I've largely recovered from all the side effects, and life is pretty much as it was before, except it caused me to take stock of how I was living, and what I was doing.

25,My catheter was removed today! 8 days ago I had RALP. I'd like to give a little insight into what the first week of recovery will be like.,17,qmu3jh,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/qmu3jh/my_catheter_was_removed_today_8_days_ago_i_had/,23,"I had surgery 8 days ago- this is what I experienced, hopefully it will help someone have a nice recovery. (Warning: might be a little graphic)

I was released before noon the day following the surgery, the nurse did a great job explaining catheter care to me and my wife, this was extremely helpful. I had about a 2 hour ride home, about 3/4 of the way home I had really bad gas pains we pulled over so I could walk a little bit. It helped ease the pain.

Night 1: gas pains, OMG.. The noise was incredible- the best relief was walking.

Day 2-3: once I started farting the pains diminished, belly was a bit bloated but I was feeling good. Still on a liquid diet until I could take a dump. Day 3 I was desperate enough to drink warm prune juice- it was bad, but not the worst thing in the world. About 3 hours after drinking the prune juice all hell broke loose and luckily I was near the toilet. Speaking of the toilet, we were able to borrow a portable topper that made you sit higher on the throne, it also had handles. This was a god-send because the first time I sat on the toilet without it, my abs felt destroyed. Warning: when it's your time to go #2 it's your time to go.

Day 4-7: most of my pain now was coming from a sore back from lying mostly on my back. Being able to roll onto a side was temporary relief. A heating pad was a huge help. Definitely get a heating pad for back pain.

Things thank made life easier: 

my wife - she was wonderful and helping me get changed, cleaning the catheter and making sure I had warm socks on ( I showered every day and she would put my change of clothes in the dryer to warm them up) she also let me have the bed to myself while she slept in the other room (the couch)


A recliner- we didn't have one- we ordered a cheap one from Amazon a few weeks before surgery- I think it was around $125. It's not the greatest, but it gets the job done. Glad we got it.

A Five Gallon Bucket- I wore the Foley Catheter most of the time (rarely using the small leg bag) I kept it in a 5 gallon bucket and it made it so much easier to walk around with- it was also easy to clean.

The toilet topper- definitely easier to sit if you're higher.

Comfortable clothes: I found what worked best while wearing the Foley catheter was baggy unlined gym shorts. I had red days and blue days.  I alternated after every shower. Blue shorts,blue tank top, blue socks. The next day red shorts, red tank top, red socks, grey hoodie (no red hoodie in the house)

Diet- taking a dump while wearing a catheter is not fun- I chose to eat a light breakfast (eggs and a muffin) and had ensure drink for lunch. For dinner another small meal like fish or meatloaf. Avoid anything that might make you gassy. Drink lots of water- I sometime mixed it with cranberry juice (not cranberry cocktail)- I was also prescribed stool softener.

Miscellaneous: baby wipes, heating pad, Neosporin. 

Things that were a problem:

The catheter- there is no getting around it, having it in for 8 days was bad. It wasn't painful but just knowing that if you bumped it, it was going to hurt. Removal was easier than I imagined and it felt great to walk out of the office without it. Some helpful things- keep it clean and apply Neosporin to the  tip of your penis 3 times a day. If you're lying down and find yourself completely comfortable and pain free- enjoy it and try not to move lol. I also found that if you were feeling discomfort at the tip of your penis, you can usually ease it by just gently moving your penis into a more comfortable position rather that trying to move the tubing.

Pets: I have a dog and a cat, the one time I sat on the couch, within 20 minutes the dog jumped on my lap. By jumping on my lap, I really mean he stepped on my dick. OUCH! More reason the recliner was better, he couldn't get on it. The cat for the most part ignored me....until the last night of the catheter. She jumped on my bed at 3am and decided she wanted to make muffins (kneading) my belly. 

Hopefully this will help someone who has just had the surgery or are in queue for the surgery. It's not that bad! If you have any specific questions let me know. YMMV

Additional tip: if you're prescribed Cialis (or generic) most likely your insurance won't cover the cost. Check out the GoodRX app. It's a free membership, you type in your prescription details and location and they will tell you what each charge. The office wanted to charge me $100 for a month, GoodRX got me to a grocery store that charges $12.

26,6-Weeks Post RALRP Report,16,qjdbev,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/qjdbev/6weeks_post_ralrp_report/,29,"Hi everyone, just wanted to give a report for those who will come after me. I had no idea what to expect (as far as when things would get better, etc).

For context, I am a fairly health 55-yo male. Gleason score of 9 dx in June. PSA was 3.7. CT scan and bone scan showed no spread. Was already doing a pilates/yoga type of workout, but doubled down on pelvic floor work for the 3 months pre-surgery.

Surgery date was 9/17/21. Here's the lowdown on my experience in the areas they tell you about (and others might): Pain, Fatigue, Fecal Incontinence, Urinary Incontinence, and Sexual Functioning. Again, my experience so YMMV.

PAIN: First week totally sucked. Just know it will be bad (catheter, various pains). Take your Tylenol, line up a lot of care and Netflix to watch and get through it.

Pain continued in the second week - very weird abdominal stuff (from the gas they use to inflate you), and especially the internal wound where the prostate was.

By now (6 weeks out), most everything has resolved, though there is still some soreness in the ex-prostate area. I am OKed to lift a bit more now, but am going to take that slow. But mostly pain-free at 6 weeks.

FATIGUE: I was a goof and thought I might work some online the second week after the surgery. No go. Scrubbed it all. 60-120 minute naps were common in weeks 1-3. Shorter naps weeks 4 & 5. More back to normal now, though I do wear out quicker. Stamina is not fully returned. Plan on naps, brothers.

FECAL INCONTINENCE: For me, had an accident the day I was discharged, and other than that, no real problems, other than fear/pain as the whole system came back online. Remember, no real food for about 48 hours, and that's after a few days of soft foods and laxatives. I was happy this was a non-event for me.

URINARY INCONTINENCE: This was depressing for a while. Post-catheter removal (one of the best days of the last few years!), was wearing Adult Depends 7x24. Doing Kegels but not holding in a thing for week 2 & 3. Saw some improvement in week 4, where I would hold in a larger amount of urine, pre-pee. Moved to Prevail pads then (really thick pads, but felt better wearing my own underwear). Noticed overnight was barely leaving a few drops.

This last week it all seemed to click. Other than stress incontinence (sneezing, coughing, LAUGHING!, etc) doing about 99%. PRO TIP: there is a much better PAD selection in the women's side of the aisle. I am now using Poise, grade 2 (lightest) in my underwear. Much better than the Prevail for men (if all you're dealing with is stress incontinence).

SEXUAL FUNCTIONING: OK, I was a little dumb and impatient, and had to see what was left. The day the catheter came out I played around until an orgasm happened. And then....electric shocks of pain all through the system. I would counsel waiting AT LEAST TWO WEEKS if not more to try it out. I did it once more at about two weeks out. Minimal pain that time. Am following advice of my acupuncturist now not to strain the system, and use the energy down there for HEALING, not orgasms right now. YMMV.

My surgery was NOT nerve sparing (due to Gleason = 9). There is nothing like an erection happening. Not sure if time will help with this. I am meeting with the urologist in 3 weeks to discuss ED options (basically shots, like Bimix). Sounds like that will be the way I go. Might look into pumps, too. But I am pessimistic about natural erections again.

Hope this helps for others to understand what is coming. 

BTW, post-surgical pathology reports were ACES. Looks like they got it all. Will have my followup PSA test on Monday. Visualizing ZEROES on that one. Happy to have to share that vision with/for me.

29,Grandpa passed away 3 days ago from Stage 4 Metastatic Prostate Cancer,16,mcct3b,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/mcct3b/grandpa_passed_away_3_days_ago_from_stage_4/,15,"My Grandpa passed away 3 days ago from Metastatic Prostate Cancer

My grandpa passed away on Saturday from Stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer at 81 years old. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer over 10 years ago with PSA of 14 initially. The doctor said he can do surgery or start doing monthly hormone injections. He said the cancer was at the very early stages so a risk of doing surgery wasn’t needed, the injections were good to keep the PSA levels from rising. My grandpa was also on blood thinners so that posed a risk as well. He had a minor lung procedure couple years ago which went well so maybe he should have done the surgery on the prostate. For 10 years the cancer stayed dormant. My grandpa was more of a father figure to me. When my parents divorced, he was like a dad to me. His is my moms father and loved me unconditionally. He always went to bat for me against my mom and grandma, always had my back and support. He was always so lively and energetic and that is how I will always remember him. 

Fast forward to last July, his PSA levels started rising quickly it went from dormant 14 to 20 to 30 to 40 to 50....etc every month. He went to do an MRI of his spine and bones, and the oncologist said they found distant metastasis in his back, which means his bones are starting to get affected. The oncologist recommended several different chemo pills, but since my grandpa was 80, these pills carried heavy side effects. One of them raised his blood pressure very high, another ones started giving him terrible cough , and the third intense headaches. My mom and grandma weren’t giving up, switching doctors to find the right treatment for him. Meanwhile as my grandpas prostate grows, he is starting to urinate more frequently at night, keeps getting more and more UTIs. After his 81st birthday in September 2020, I could see he is slightly getting weaker. He was still walking trying to exercise but something in his eyes hit me and my anticipatory grief began. Slowly but surely the process began. His PSA level was 200, and started having pains in his lower back. The whole month of February to March, my mom and grandparents were getting vaccinated so my mom didn’t want me coming over until they were fully vaccinated but everyday I would call and my heart would break. It would kill me inside hearing that radiation isn’t working, his pains are getting worse, and two weeks to his passing it spread so much to his spine that he could barely get up to use the bathroom. Hearing how much pain he was is in, would tear me piece by piece.I would cry everyday just thinking of my poor grandpa struggling to do basic things.My parents thought they could prolong his life but I couldn’t bear or see my grandpa in that state, and that’s why I pray to god that due to the vaccine I didn’t see him in that state. 

Prior to the fact that he was in so much pain he lost his appetite his favorite food gave him an aversion and all he wanted was oatmeal my grandma said. He’s Oncologist recommended him going to Cedars-Sinai Hospital where we live in Los Angeles for vitamin and nutrient IV since he wasn’t eating and he was admitted a week ago. He didn’t want to go to the hospital but my mom and my grandma forced him to because they were so concerned that he could barely walk he’s not eating but they still had hope,I knew that sooner or later the dreadful day is about to come. As he got admitted to Cedar Sinai, I was able to see him and thankfully the Charge Nurse made an exception for me to stay overnight since due to Covid you can only have one person per day to visit. During his hospital stay he developed hospital acquired pneumonia, I was by his bedside overnight for three days, while my mom and grandma would take turns being with him during the day. Oh my last night he was still conscious he was still good and the very last night before the pneumonia started spreading we had we had a good talk he said as long as everything is good with you then everything is good with me I’m just so happy that he saw me by his bedside while he was still there and the fact that I was able to talk to him and when I saw him at the hospital since he was laying down he didn’t look so weak or frail in the bed as opposed to if I had the chance to see him at my grandmas house. his pneumonia started spreading he had to be rushed to the ICU put on a ventilator and eventually his blood pressure started going down I prayed for a peaceful quick and graceful passing and he did. I told him my own goodbye because I refused to go to the ICU and see him hooked to a machine with tubes everywhere. I’m so happy our last interaction was the best it could have been and that is how I will always see him as. Since I started having anticipatory grief since October 2020 when the passing actually happened I feel emotional but not as emotional because I’m glad that my grandpa is not in pain anymore and he’s not suffering hearing him suffer every day would have me suffer every day and that’s not a life that I want him to live or remember him by. My mom and grandma were also realistic about his condition but they weren’t as prepared as I was there for right now they’re going through sudden grief it makes me feel good that he lived a full long life he passed right before the true suffering began and I know that he’s watching over now in peace.

Which can then help predict the need for closer monitoring after your treatment. You could also consider having a test to see if you have a BRCA mutation, which is a genetic mutation passed down within families associated with increased risk prostate, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.

38,DIAGNOSING PROSTATE CANCER - getting to biopsy,16,hcdklp,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hcdklp/diagnosing_prostate_cancer_getting_to_biopsy/,3,"  

**Memo – re: screening and diagnosing prostate cancer** (with endnotes for those interested in more detail): 

Prostate cancer (“PCa”) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.

My recent experience of a diagnosis of PCa—and consequent prostatectomy—has led me to adopt the often-heard refrain of many activists, “If sharing my experience helps just one person, it’s worth it.” 

For many years my annual PSA values had been consistently good—ranging between 1.8 and 2.1. Most recently, at age 69, the value increased to 3.05, which is well below the age-adjusted ‘standard/acceptable’ range of ≤ 4.5. The physical exam (DRE) was normal, and there were no PCa-related symptoms. During my GP’s review of the annual blood test results, he offered no comment about the comparatively elevated 3.05 value. \[Of note, and not uncommon in the medical community, he generally discourages routine PSA testing altogether.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn1)\] The higher PSA value, however, continued to bother me, and two months later I arranged to meet with him to discuss my concern. Despite my family history of PCa, he did not recommend a retest, but reluctantly agreed. That result (3.15) was only 0.1% higher, and his response was essentially, “See, no problem.” This was appeasing for a while, but it still gnawed at me, and four months afterward I returned and insisted on getting another test. 

Damned if that didn’t come in at 4.85 … and I was ‘off to urology.’ 

Although PSA tests often accurately indicate the presence/absence of PCa, it is generally acknowledged that the tests have a relatively high incidence of returning false-positive/false-negative results. My false-negative value was nevertheless quite valuable, i.e., the elevated value from the previous year was *possibly provocative*, and was the catalyst for receiving lifesaving treatment. As I subsequently learned, PSA test results point only towards the advisability of getting other types of blood and urine tests also useful in determining the possibility of PCa. One of the additional tests ordered by the urologist (together with another PSA retest (5.71)) is named, “Free PSA.”[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn2) He found this value (7%) to be “particularly concerning.” Searching further online, a ‘concerning’ Free PSA value can often be highly correlative to the presence of high-risk/aggressive PCa, and thus his strong encouragement to explore further with prostate imaging.

Ultrasound[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn3) is the most common prostate diagnostic imaging method used in the U.S. However, in the past few years, *diagnostic* MRIs for PCa[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn4) are being used more and more frequently. Currently, most insurers will initially deny coverage.[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn5) I opted to pay the cost ($3,750-reimbursed after determination of PCa), and upon scheduling, also arranged to become a new patient of one of a handful of U.S. world-class urologists/surgeons (and thereafter couldn’t feel in better hands). 

All tests and imaging up to this point in time are done for the sole purpose of determining whether it is then prudent to biopsy prostate tissue.

The MRI, which did indicate a “suspicious lesion,” was reviewed by two radiologists (one by the first urologist’s dept. which ordered it, and the second by the ‘world-class’ urologist’s dept.). When a lesion is evident, the radiologist will assign a “PI-RADS score” of 1 to 5. Although both radiologists used the same MRI, one ‘read’ of the lesion was “PI-RADS 2” (meaning, ‘probably benign’ and biopsy not necessarily indicated), and the other was “PI-RADS 4” (‘probably malignant’ and biopsy definitely advised). Big difference! The biopsy results confirmed PCa in 2 quadrants (Gleason Score 7 (4+3)). Further genomic testing[\[6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_edn6) of the tissue samples identified the type of cancer as “high-risk and aggressive,” whereby treatment was definitely required. Various less-invasive treatments were discussed, researched, and rejected. One alternative of note was ‘laser ablation’ offered by a specialty clinic (with a high-profile online presence). Laser and other ablation techniques are most often used for treating lower-risk types of cancers found in relatively small area(s) of the prostate. They can be an attractive alternative because they do not have, or have to a lesser degree, the (often temporary) urinary incontinence and ED side effects of prostate removal. The clinic’s surgeon/owner reviewed my MRI and test results, assured me, ‘yes, you’re a good fit for our treatment,’ and fully encouraged my traveling for his procedure \[cost 25k - not covered\]. This prompted my getting a second opinion from the head of Cleveland Clinic Urology. He confidently recommended a prostatectomy, and as later evidenced by the post-surgical pathology, the ablative route would have been a serious mistake. 

Primary takeaways from the forgoing are:

\- Neither high, nor low, PSA values are *reliable* indicators of the presence or absence of PCa. The PSA test is, however, importantly and deservedly the gold standard **first step** in determining one’s risk of having PCa. A substantial number (perhaps a majority) of doctors in the U.S. continue to be strong proponents of routine testing for all men over 50. 

\- If the PSA value is the least bit concerning, and/or there is a family history of PCa, and/or there are other indications one may be at higher risk, **be certain to ask about—and seriously consider getting (either annually or periodically)—other tests**, even if they’re not covered and a few dollars come out-of-pocket. Physicians (possibly overly conscious of insurance company scrutiny of their ‘tests ordered’ metrics), might very well push back. With the advent of diagnostic MRIs and the availability of other tests, the number of unnecessary biopsies has been significantly reduced, thus weakening ‘old school’ physicians’ rationale for not testing. Regardless of the doctor’s preference, **all testing decisions are made by the patient.** 

With relative certainty, had I deferred to the GP’s twice-given advice not to retest, I would have then been dealing with life-threatening advanced Stage 4 PCa at the next annual physical. Because the GP had not even mentioned—much less recommended—any of the additional tests available, many months passed unnecessarily before surgery. **Time is of the essence.**

\- Get second (possibly third) opinions from urologists … and radiologists.

\[Regarding my current status, the surgeon was surprised that the pathology indicated PCa outside of the prostate in one of the routinely dissected lymph nodes. Disappointing, but nevertheless treatable should subsequent PSA testing indicate a presence elsewhere. Recently, he offered, “The fact that you have no PSA value months after surgery is hugely positive!” This can, of course, change. Regardless, I’m doing fine and fully expect at least another two decades.\] 

This is simply a unilateral ‘fyi message,’ and no one should feel the least bit obliged to respond. 

**Best wishes for ‘good things’ to all!**

[**\[1\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_ednref1) **Routine** **PSA testing** – is discouraged by the American Academy of Family Physicians. For ages 55-69, the AAFP advises: “There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small … we do not recommend routine PSA-based prostate cancer screening;"" and for age ≥70, “… currently recommends against the service … there is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.” The AAFP’s primary concern is the risks of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. **In my case, my ‘net benefit’ from routine PSA testing was** ***exceedingly beneficial*****!**

[**\[2\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_ednref2) **Free PSA** – more particularly, “free-to-total PSA ratio.” PCa risk calculators are available online ([http://riskcalc.org/PCPTRC/](http://riskcalc.org/PCPTRC/)), and are often used by physicians. Using my stats (PSA 5.71, age 69, normal DRE, family history), my calculated risk of PCa is shown as: “11% chance of high-grade PCa; 25% chance of low-grade; and 64% chance that the biopsy is negative.” However, when only my Free PSA value (7%) is added, the results become: “36% chance of high-grade PCa; 55% chance of low-grade; and 9% chance that the biopsy is negative.” Overall risk of PCa changes from 36% to 91%!

[**\[3\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_ednref3) **Ultrasound imaging/biopsies** – commonly follow concerning PSA values, especially when accompanied with symptoms and/or when other tests so indicate. Ultrasound provides relatively poor quality images, and ‘suspicious areas’ in the prostate are often missed. If the ultrasound procedure does not indicate abnormal tissue, it is nevertheless common to randomly biopsy the four prostate quadrants. Because they are random, however, malignant tissue only millimeters away from the biopsy sites can easily be missed, and false-negative results are all too frequent. \[Just one person’s ‘for what it’s worth’ note on the biopsy procedure, mine was only once slightly uncomfortable for 2-3 seconds, and totally painless.\]

[**\[4\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_ednref4) **MRIs** – unlike ultrasound, are non-invasive, and more importantly, provide far better image quality. Better imaging has three main advantages: 1) evidencing abnormal tissue otherwise not shown with ultrasound; 2) if nothing looks amiss, the physician has a higher degree of confidence in determining whether random biopsies are at all necessary, thereby avoiding altogether an unnecessary biopsy and its concomitant invasiveness, the (2-5%) risk of infection, and rare instances of false-positives; and 3) if a lesion is shown, sophisticated software enables the subsequent biopsy samples to be taken from exact ‘target’ locations more clearly shown on the MRI. A few medical practices in the U.S. are equipped to perform both the MRI and biopsies simultaneously in real time. 

[**\[5\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/submit#_ednref5) **MRI insurance coverage** – may initially be denied. However, often the claims will subsequently be accepted upon a “peer-to-peer review” between the insurer and physician. Apparently the trend is towards full coverage by all insurers—hopefully realized before long. In the meantime, costs can also be mitigated by shopping for a less expensive imaging facility.

**\[6\]** **Genomic testing** –  has experienced breakthrough advances in recent years, enabling far greater accuracy (via biopsy samples) in identifying and differentiating the types of PCa, further classified on a scale of low-risk to high-risk. In years past, without the benefit of genomic testing, many patients having low-risk PCa were unnecessarily ‘over-treated,’ e.g., prostatectomy surgery, whereas (as many have heard) their demise would likely occur from something else long before PCa.",2020-06-20 01:51:00+00:00,"['I agree: sharing experiences is valuable for others.

Today is my 3 monthiversary, If there is such a word, of my prostatectomy and I thought I share my progress. 

As a recap, I’m 66 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer after a biopsy last September. My surgery was done at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on Friday the 13th of November 2020. My 6 week post op PSA was below the detection level. Check out my previous posts for more details. 

So, I’m progressing well with my bladder control. Not as fast as I would like but faster than I expected. I started playing pickleball again this week and after 90 minutes of running around I used about a third of the capacity of a Depends Guard pad. For the last 2 weeks, in a normally active day, I use a Depends Shield (small) pad without saturating it in 24 hours. I leak a bit when I sneeze or laugh, which is not so bad. My wife tells me “welcome to my world!”  

On the sexual function side, I’ve been taking a 5mg generic Cialis daily for 6 weeks now with no erection action going on. I do have arousal sensation, which is a good sign. My urologist tells me to be patient, as he did for bladder control, so I’m quite optimistic erectile function is in my future. At my age, this was going to take longer anyway, but with all things in life, it’s hard to be patient when one wants it now!

I had been feeling a little off, I’m very in tune with body and I insisted for digital exam from my primary care provider, because I had asked before and he told me I was too young healthy and no family history.

MRI was next and verified the suspicion, Rt side of prostate, w/o mets. Biopsy was done late July with a Gleason of 7.

He immediately had a zoom conference with me and my wife answered all our questions and gave me his personal cell number and his secretary’s.  My primary Dr in New Mexico got my pre op checklist done in one day which consisted of EKG, medical clearance, chest X-ray, cardiologist clearance, urine analysis and bloodwork.

Surgery was 2.5 hrs he told us upon removing my prostate he said it was severely bulging on the right and as to why I had to do a little larger than normal incision to be able to accommodate the prostate. He also took the seminal vesicles and bilateral lymph nodes.

Post-op : Woke up in horrible pain it took morphine, and 3x dose IV dilauded to control it. Once under control I only need/had 3x doses of po 5mg oxy. My hospital stay was 2 days.  I do take 1000mg Tylenol every 8 hrs and that seems to do the trick and I walk for 30-45 min a day. The most discomfort is the damn foley (catheter) if it wasn’t needed activity would be much greater and as far pain it would be more of a  soreness. THREE more days and it’s out!

Man stuff: From what I can tell and I realized early I wake up with morning wood and we’ll have to see about the voiding when the catheter is out. Please feel free to ask ask me anything and I will try to answer.

One thing is certain when I woke up from surgery and the pain was taken care of I had the greatest sense of like the entire world was off my shoulders. To me prior to surgery I thought I was handling the stress just fine but I bet I wasn’t! So those of who currently going thru all this you really need to talk it out with anyone you feel comfortable with!

UPDATE:  My Dr called me my Gleason was an actual 8 not the 7.

48,I've decided on da Vinci prostatectomy. My surgery is scheduled for late October.,13,pu32g4,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/pu32g4/ive_decided_on_da_vinci_prostatectomy_my_surgery/,47,"55 years old, I consider myself to be in great health. I'm a regular runner and workout out 6 days a week. My only physical sign of something wrong was frequent urination- I thought it was caused by  drinking lots of water. Routine PSA for my yearly showed 5.9. I had the biopsy, decipher genetic testing and MRI. They basically gave me 3 choices: Cyber Knife, Brachytherapy (permanent seeds) or Surgery. 

The first surgeon I went to didn't portray a lot of confidence and suggested I talk to an Oncologist. He was very thorough and discussed the differences between the seeds and the Cyber Knife. I told him I wasn't sure about radiation and didn't have confidence in the surgeon. I also want to avoid hormone therapy. He gave me the name of the most experienced da Vinci surgeon in my region. I went to him for a second opinion and everything he said made sense.

I made my decision based on my age and health. I feel that being on the 'younger' side I didn't want to risk the long term results of having radiation. I also didn't like the idea of leaving a 'dead organ"" in my body. I would rather have a tooth pulled that a root canal. My wife came with me to several of the appointments and I thought this really helped ease her mind and contribute to the decision process. I'm fortunate to have a job where I have enough sick time built up + short term disability that missing work won't be an issue. The Doctor expects me to be out about 6 weeks. My goal is to get back into running after a full recovery and run a half marathon by  this time next year.  This subreddit  has been a wealth of information and hopefully I can give some insight to someone going through the same thing. I've got  a little over a month until surgery.

Better than normal, in fact, because now we‘re minus the anxiety and worry. Clean, wide margins and husband is now cancer-free.\n\nMy husband is 55, very physically active, has a demanding job. Runs the service department at a Jeep place, so on his feet all day. The surgery was a breeze. Happened on a Tuesday, he went home Thursday. At home recovering for a week, then he went back to work. Still wearing Depends now, 4 weeks out, but goes through fewer and fewer each week. It went so much smoother than either of us expected — being in good health makes all the difference.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n* Get a soft, GIGANTIC bathrobe to wear home from the hospital and for the next couple days at home. Sew a big pocket (just a square, nothing fancy) on the inside to hold your “go bag” (the catheter bag). You want it a couple sizes larger than your usual because your gut will be puffy from being inflated, and to minimize rubbing on your incisions.\n* Yes you will go home with a catheter. By far the worst part. My husband had it for a week. You’ll get the catheter removed at your follow-up appointment, which they will schedule in advance. It’s standard to schedule it for two weeks post. When the doc pops by to check on you, ask how your catheter looks and if you can move the follow-up earlier. If we hadn’t asked, it would have been two weeks instead of one. \n* i bought a ton of products to have on hand. Should have waited, they are expensive. My husband never needed the bed pads or the maxi-pads or the tape kind (like diapers). He went straight from no underwear to the Depends pull-ups. We tried a lot of different kinds and those are his favorite. Not bulky, hold a lot, don’t tear, easy to pull up and down.\n\nI obsessed about what to expect, what to buy, etc. — I should have relaxed. If you have a supportive partner and a good surgeon it’s going to be fine. We binged Ted Lasso and laughed a lot and filled a whole bunch of Depends in the process. Enjoy your pre- and post- time together and be happy to be alive.', 'Kegels every day. Then more kegels. Oh, and some kegels.', 'Random one-off: if you (or anyone reading) is prescribed ciproflaxicin as an antibiotic to prevent a uti (urinary track infection) from catheter after RP, be super careful with physical activity.

Beware of Cipro and Achilles rupture.', ""I am similar, 49, didn't have any symptoms that I thought was out of the ordinary. I do have a family history of it so I was not shocked but somewhat dejected because of my age. My dad was about 70 with his.

If you are a regular runner and workout 6 days a week, you will do excellent. I had my surgery exactly 4 weeks ago today and ran 3 miles this morning and I'll probably run the Houston Half Marathon in January and I just signed up for Texas 70.3 Half ironman in April. I've never felt more confident about it too.\n\nI was already doing a lot of plyometric jumping and core work but leading up to the surgery I added kegels to my bridges exercises for 2 months before. I feel that was important because I have not experienced any incontinence since the catheter was removed. I think a couple of times when I unexpectedly laughed at my daughters or sneezed. First week I was conscious to squeeze when getting up and down and always go to the bathroom when you feel it coming on. But everything is becoming second nature now.

But I didn\'t drive until catheter was removed, so just under 2 weeks (schedule complications / weekends had it in for WAY longer than the 8 to 9 days originally expected -- NOT fun.)  6 weeks was expected before allowed to lift more than 10 pounds, so if you have a heavy lifting job, expect to wait out the full time, and don\'t cheat!\n\n\nIf you\'re feeling like you really want to be on top of the whole catheter thing, get yourself some ""Cathwear Catheter Leg Bag Underwear"" and figure out how to use it ahead of time. It really helps to keep the tube from pulling funny, and you don\'t have to bother with all of the bag straps and shifting bag during the day. Also, emptying the bag is super easy, because there\'s valve access through the bottom. (Have them on Amazon, etc...)\n\nMake SURE you get a LARGE catheter bag for overnight. I used a nice new Home Depot 5 gallon bucket next to my bed and just hung the bag inside that in case of any bag overflow accidents at night - My large bag had an overflow valve near the top so that it doesn\'t back up -- the smaller bags do not. Never had any issues, but it was good to know that I was covered. Also was really handy for changing out bags over that in the morning and evening; I almost always had a bit of flow from the tube as I was switching, guess I needed better coordination. \n\nTwo more tips that I got from the PA before my surgery, that turned out to be game savers:\n\n1 - you\'re on pretty heavy laxatives after surgery so that you don\'t strain - get some Desitin  for diaper rash, and apply it pretty thoroughly (apply it like you would with hemorrhoid cream - it will pretty much stay all day) awhile BEFORE bowel movements - will save you from major hemorrhoids flaring. I didn\'t have any history of hemorrhoids  before the surgery, so I didn\'t follow the advice initially -- I found out what MAJOR hemmorrhoid irritation is like - Desitin cleared it up almost overnight.\n\n2 - Get some Lanolin Cream for the tip of your penis and around the catheter tube where it enters. This will GREATLY reduce irritation from the tube. But be very clean with it, so that you don\'t get an infection.  You can get it in the breastfeeding section of a pharmacy - it\'s sold to reduce nipple pain / chaffing during breastfeeding.', 'I would advise finding a pelvic floor therapist to help you.

Your experiences, both first hand and otherwise, were good to hear. 

As I mentioned in my OP edit the surgery went well. I came home yesterday (Wednesday) and that was a bit rough frankly. I’d spent the majority of my limited hospital stay in bed and I could remote control it so that was easy and minimal pain. Even the first walk around the hall wasn’t too bad. But getting in the wheelchair and then the car to go home was miserable. Not that I’ve ever done 1000 sit-ups but I think that must be what it feels like.  Plus deeper in the pelvic floor I could/can feel some discomfort. But very manageable. No pain meds other than some tylonal yesterday. 

Showered yesterday and that helped. Looking at that damnable catheter still creeps me out but I’m definitely more used to it. I slept fairly well too. I’m (surprisingly to me at least) dizzy when I stand up. But not a big deal once I get my bearings. Lots of laps around the house today. 

My only “issue” now is I haven’t had a bowel movement yet. And that’s not my nature. They started with stool softeners in the hospital and I’m doing those and prunes etc. I’m sure that will work itself out—so to speak. ;)

Catheter out on Monday and then they’ll start me on viagra. Back the following week for pathology follow up. I’m certainly glad I did this and caught it in time. We’ll see how the ED goes down the road. If you’re on the fence don’t hesitate. 

Again thanks for the support.

But this is an important issue and I want to raise awareness.

In November of 2018 I was diagnosed with stage T2b intermediate stage prostate cancer. Worse yet; genetically it was an *aggressive* form of prostate cancer.

It really knocked me on my backside to hear that doctor tell me this. I was stunned.. I was totally caught off guard.. I cried.. I was scared.. all of it. But to give context it'd been a pretty rough 18 months:

- My mother died in June of 2017
- My father died in April of 2018
- My uncle (mom's older brother) died in August of 2018

So in the shock of this news given all the grief I'd been dealing with over the past 18 months my first thought on the diagnosis was; 'Am I next?'

Interestingly when I think about it I think what I experienced was a brief microcosm of the stages of grief.. I tried to deny the diagnosis, but there it was right in front of me.. I got angry about it.. I started looking to find another doctor to get a second opinion.. maybe the first one was wrong..? But again.. there was the diagnosis and the facts were all laid out in front of me. And facts don't care about your fears.. And as anyone around me can tell you I got depressed.. it was ZERO fun to be around me during these last holidays.. but then I realized all of that was doing nothing but hurting me and even more so the people around me. I was still scared.. but I couldn't sit still.. I had to do something.

My wife was a huge help in bringing me around. I could not have gotten thru this without her.

Over the course of a few weeks following my diagnosis I was talking to my urologist to work out a plan of action - he strongly encouraged me to opt for surgery over radiation.. after doing some additional research it didn't take long to find out why: given the aggressive form of the cancer using radiation would leave a 'question mark' behind about it ever returning. And if the cancer returned.. well, I would be out of options. As scary as the notion of surgery was that was the first, best option and I really only thought about radiation briefly. And through all of it I just had to keep remembering one thing:

-- I was going to have the final word on this cancer.. *I* was having the final say.. there was going to be no 'question mark' for me. I was getting it out by any means necessary and getting on with my life. Was I still scared? Oh heck yes I was still scared.. I'm not a fool.. but the sooner I got treatment the better.

My urologist referred me to Swedish Urology for treatment; ""I'm good.. but they're *better* and I think you need to see them for treatment."" More blood tests.. more planning.. all thru December.. in January I met with my surgeon.. and got on the schedule.

A few weeks ago I went in for surgery to remove the cancer.. Anyone reading this probably is at least familiar with the surgery. And I'm sure you can find that part on Google yourself if not. Look up ""da vinci robotic surgery"" and you can find out all you ever wanted to know. My wife and I had to drive thru the final snow of the year where we live on the day of the surgery but all went to plan. My wife kept me company during the surgery pre-op while I chatted with the anesthesiologist, the nurses, and while they all completed the final checklists prior to surgery. Honestly.. I really wasn't all that nervous at first.. and then I saw my her walk away to go to surgery waiting.

Then... that's when I was scared. That moment what was going to happen next became very concrete and very real. Maybe I should have taken them up on the offer of valium prior to going in for surgery. Noted for next time, tho I hope there isn't a next time.

Overall surgery went OK.. there were a couple of hiccups during surgery and surgery ran long, resulting in an extra night's stay at the hospital, but all went according to plan, otherwise. The pain was really awful.. Oxycodone helped but I really didn't enjoy watching letters on the dry erase board melting down the board when I was on the Oxycodone so I tried to keep usage to a minimum.

My wife never left my side those nights either. She slept on a lousy little cot next to me... That gal has a ton of strength and courage. Maybe I should get her something extra for her birthday..? Um... wait.. don't tell her I said that.. come to think of it she *was* looking at diamonds at the store the other day.. coincidence, I'm sure....

I went for my first follow-up this week and reviewed the final pathology report. Overall the results were good.. No metastasis. Health-wise I'm doing OK too. I'm still a bit sore and I'm still in recuperation mode but I'm getting better every day. Am I out of the woods yet? Well, for the most part, yes. There's some question that some of the cancer may have been left behind. It was making a good attempt to leave the prostate area and raise all kinds of trouble: Between my initial biopsy and the final pathology report it appears that the cancer actually advanced in those few months.  My initial biopsy showed a Gleason of 4+3=7. But final pathology showed 4+5=9.  I definitely made the right call opting for surgery. If I do still need follow-on radiation it will be minimal.. focused.. and final.

So why am I sharing all of this? Am I under the delusion that people care about what's going on with me? No.. I'm not so egocentric.. well, not so much these days, anyway. I'm doing it because I'm hoping to shake a few people out of their seats. I'm doing it so hopefully those of you reading this and are concerned about themselves don't ignore it. Looking back there were warning signs that I just dismissed as my getting older. You always hear those ads on TV from the GNC's out there for supplements that always have that overarching context in their message of ""Getting older..? It's OK.. you'll be FINE! Just look! We've got a supplement for that!"" So I figured 'what's the big deal'? That was stupid and almost cost me the battle. So ask yourself:

- Are you over 40? 
- Do you have ANY family history of reproductive or pancreatic cancers in either the men or women in your family? Yes.. your grandmother having cervical cancer when she was 80 counts.
- Have you noticed ANY changes or discomfort of ANY kind when sitting down? Using the restroom? Riding a bicycle?
- Any discharge in your underwear and you haven't had sex?
- Did you just think after reading all of the above; ""Eh this won't happen to me..""

If you answered 'yes' to any of these, I have some advice: GO TO A DOCTOR. GO. GO NOW.

Talk to your doctor and get a PSA test.. If the doctor says; ""You don't need that. Those are not really all that accurate"" FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR. PSA tests DO work.. My PSA was only 7 (normal is 1 to 4) and frankly my first urologist didn't even think they would FIND anything.. but here we are one prostatectomy later.. PSA tests are easy.. draw some blood.. they come back a few days later. If it's below 4 then just check it again in 6 months and make sure it didn't go up from there. But DO go to a doctor and get checked out. Over 50? Then definitely get a direct exam.

Also did you know that the percentage of males with prostate cancer goes up linearly with their age? It does: 30% of males in their 30's have prostate cancer.. 40% of males in their 40's.. etc. Recent studies of deep tissue autopsies found this and urologists are taking these findings seriously. That means that while a PSA of 7 would normally be a 1 in 4 chance of being positive for prostate cancer, my age turns that to 1 in 2. A cointoss.. that's not worth your life.

I ignored and dismissed what - upon looking back - were actually early warnings that I should have taken seriously. Of course no guy wants to go to a urologist and have these discussions. You're worried that will invariably be followed by a direct exam. Sparing yourself of a few SECONDS of ignominy is NOT worth your life. And these docs have heard EVERYTHING.

One other thing: Ignore all of the stupid supplement ads on TV for ""Super Beta Prostate Widgetmacallit Homeopathic Super Man in the Bedroom Just text 867 to 5309 and Jenny will thank you"" BS. I ignored them, because it all sounded stupid.. I mean really there's no 'magic pill' that will make everything OK for your health as a man. Even worse you're risking your life taking that junk. Why? Because most of those all have Saw Palmetto in them.. I've read multiple ""natural news"" websites that go on and on about the miracle of Saw Palmetto. Why see a doctor? Just take this supplement. You'll be fine! To heck with ALL of them. All of those website authors are all nuts. That stuff can actually artificially *suppress* your PSA levels and make it look like everything is fine, meanwhile you have a timebomb inside waiting to could go off. So, yes.. Super Male Saw Palmetto Homeopathic Super Man in the Bedroom will help with one thing: killing you.

Go get checked.. go talk to a doctor.. go *now*. 

One thing I want to close with.. thanks to my wife. I know this has been rough.. I'm glad you're here. I really don't think I could have done this without you. I love you, doll.",2019-03-19 05:28:01+00:00,"['rough', ""I had Green light laser surgery for my prostate last November.\n\nMy PSA score was 15.3 and a Gleason of 7.

Was diagnosed in Jul 2012, with metastases to pelvis and spine (PSA 17.4), prior year was 2.0.  Had casodex and bicalutimide for 11 months, then tried Phase 2 Clinical Trial with Galaterone for one month before breaking out with hives, head to foot.  Then Enzalutimide for 33 months, before had to stop for extreme fatigue and slowly rising PSA.  Had genetic biopsy, then Provenge.  A Phase 1 clinical trial for AZD-8186, with severe Liver injury, took 6 weeks for liver to recover, tried again at half dose, had to stop after 6 days, due to liver #'s.  Then tried abiraterone, PSA leveled for one month, then increased. Within 30 days, Liver metastases and spinal cord nerve canal compression, resulted in 19 radiation treatments.  Immediately followed by docetaxel and carbo platin, every three weeks.  Chemo lays me out flat in my bed for five to seven days after two-three day respite from initial steriod injection after each chemo cycle injection.  PSA has been reducing since start of chemo from 42 to 0.43.  However, prior 40% reduction each cycle is now reduced to 10%.  Will have to continue to take chemo until side effects get so bad I have to stop or scans (CT and bone) show progression (liver, bone, lymphs).

Tough to enjoy what life is left when sick for 50% of time after each chemo.   PSA was doubling every three weeks before I started radiation and chemo.

Sorry for repetition if you have read one my rants before.

Was diagnosed with prostate cancer, had the RALP 15 months ago.  Urologist says nerves were spared.

Cancer is gone : repeated PSA tests yield no discernible result (< 0.01).

Incontinence took nine months to cure, now more or less OK (one adult diaper a day still necessary).

However, on the sexual front : TOTAL loss.  No erections (despite use of Viagra, Cialis and  Alprostadil) and more importantly, no sexual sensitivity at all (i.e., no orgasm when flaccid, not even any ""tingling"").

So, basically I have saved my life but at the cost of total sexual loss.  Oddly, libido is still intact ""above the waist"" (still enjoy eye candy, still have the urge to touch, to kiss, etc.) but ""below the waist"", zilch, niente, nichts, rien, nothing.

They have been immensely helpful in his journey so I wanted to give back by sharing his story.  
They found his PC at age 57 with just slight increases of 0.2 in his PSA over this spring with several repeated tests.  Ending PSA was 3.2.  It was the slight increases that were of concern, not the PSA number itself.  
Nothing was felt through DRE.  MRI showed 5 lesions, 4 considered highly suspicious for cancer.  Next,  22 biopsies using ultrasound and MRI results as guide.  The MRI indicated no obvious spread outside of the prostate.  Ask your doc to put you under anesthesia for biopsies.  No pain and a given with his urologist.  Only one of the 5 lesions was cancer, but 10 of the 22 cores take all around showed cancer (Gleason 3 + 3).  He was not a candidate for surveillance because of the number of cores having cancer and they were found on both lobes of the prostate.   Doc suggested that he do Something within the year.  He chose the Da Vinci prostatectomy.   This was done a week ago.  He was home in 28 hours and no pain just abdominal pressure.  Pathology results received yesterday showed that the cancer was actually a Gleason 7 (3 + 4).  For those considering surveillance be mindful that 40% of Gleason score pathologies go up from biopsy results so it may be a higher stage in actuality.   
He’s now on the road to recovery without the catheter and teaching his body how to control urine flow. Something we weren’t aware of until recently was that men have 2 (some say 3) urethral sphincters.  The one in the bladder neck is removed during surgery.   The external sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor muscles, is left to do the job.  This is why it is SO important to start Kegels way in advance of surgery to strengthen the muscle.

65,"38 Years Old, Stage 4/Gleason 8, Looking for Guidance",12,pq28gl,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/pq28gl/38_years_old_stage_4gleason_8_looking_for_guidance/,32,"Hi everyone,

I've lurked here for a while since getting my diagnosis back in July, and finally have told enough people that I feel like can start to post here for support.

This all started as what looked to be a normal UTI back in April. I had some difficulty urinating and went to my GP, who confirmed that I had Klebsiella pneumoniae. I went on an antibiotic and set up an appointment with a urologist near me. My PSA was originally 70.86, and the prostate felt enlarged to him, so he recommended a cystoscopy and imaging. The cystoscopy found pollops on my prostate, and after a biopsy was done I was diagnosed with Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4/4 8. MRI imaging confirmed this, and showed that it has spread to seminal vesicals, may have started to spread to bladder, and I have multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the area. A catscan confirmed there has been no spread to bone as of yet, which is really the only good news I've gotten on this.

I have a history of Cancer in my family, so I expected this at some point, but getting this news at 37 was not something I was ready for at all.

I'm lucky that I live in Rhode Island, about an hour and 20 minutes outside of some of the best doctors in the world in Boston. I've met with several of them, and need to make a choice on who I want quarterbacking this, which is why I've decided to post here for input.

I met with a Urologist in Boston first, Dr. [Francis McGovern](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/16733/Francis-McGovern) out of Mass General. He is widely known throughout Boston as one of the best Urologists, and I feel like I'd want him to handle my prostatectomy when it comes to that eventually.

In my first visit with McGovern, I said I was having difficulty getting an appointment with a reputable oncologist in the area. McGovern immediately called [Dr. Matthew Smith](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17193/matthew-smith) and got me an appointment with him. Smith is the Director of the Oncology program at Mass General, and has a ton of of credentials in the world of Prostate cancer.

I met with Smith, and like every other Doctor I've met with, he recommended 6 months of Hormone Therapy, I got 2 doses of Firmagone injected after meeting with him. Though I was impressed with his credentials and background, I was less impressed with his bedside manner. My first visit with him he said, ""Just so you're aware, what you have isn't curable. It's containable, but not curable."" My father was with me and gave him a look, to which he said ""....but obviously a cure is what we're trying for.""

Hearing from one of the best Oncologists in the field that I have something that can't be cured....sent me spiraling. In the week afterwards I had heavy depression, drank too much, not sleeping, all of it. Now I don't want my doctors to mince words, but I need *something* to fight for. So after that appointment, I did not feel like I had a doctor that was really in my corner, and that trait is very important to me.

This past Monday the 13th, I went to the Dana Farber Institute. I had booked this appointment a while back, but this was the soonest appointment I could get, and it was with a Urologist, Oncologist, and a Radiation Oncologist.

All 3 of them were around my age. I had such a better rapport with all of them than any Doctor I've seen thus far. The Urologist and Oncologist met with me together, and then I met with the Oncologist ([Dr. Jacob Berchuck](https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jacob-berchuck/)) afterwards. Dr. Berchuck gave me hope, and I felt way more comfortable with him than Dr. Smith, even though their experience levels are significantly different.

So long story longer, who would you go with? I plan on going with Dr. McGovern for my Urologist, because I want someone with experience for my prostatectomy. For Med Oncologist I'm leaning towards Berchuck at Dana Farber, despite him having less experience than Dr. Smith, I feel like being able to establish a rapport and having a positive outlook are very important traits to have as an Oncologist.

Some other questions while I'm writing this up, has anyone had any positive experience with Firmagone? I may also be starting another hormone therapy on top of Firmagone, Zytiga or Enzalutamide. Any experience with those would be helpful.

Sorry about the length of this post! Really appreciate any feedback from anyone that's read this far.

**TLDR:** 38, have cancer, should I choose a medical oncologist based off of experience, or based off of their positive outlook?",2021-09-17 15:23:03+00:00,"['I was diagnosed at 43 with Stage 4 Gleason 8/9/10. The cancer had already escaped my prostate into nearby lymph nodes. I\'ve been on hormone ( Lupron+Zytiga)  therapy for just shy of two years and have had a prostatectomy and radiation. I\'m now 45.\n\nIt sounds like you\'re making g good choices. I consulted with three different hospitals before landing at UCSD. They had a cohesive team, or ""one stop shop"" and are a reasonable drive from my home. They are also part of the  National Cancer Institure ( NCI ); like all NCI-hospitals they get reasearch funding from federal government and are at the forefront of what\'s available treatment-wise.\n\nHave you had a bone scan to see if the cancer has mestatizied to your bones? Also, I started with Degarelix and was switched to Lupron after a month. Why?  Lupron causes a testosterone ""surge""; Degarelix does not. My oncologist wanted to avoid the surge and ""feeding"" my cancer. \n\nI\'ve written extensively about my so-called ""Cancer Journey"". I try and keep it upbeat and as funny as cancer will allow. Given that you might be starting Degarelix I suggest you start here:\n\nhttps://drawnandcoded.com/2019/11/14/let-the-games-begin/\n\nGood luck ❤', 'Getting that diagnosis at a young age is pretty rotten.  I was 47 when I got my stage 3 diagnosis, and that was enough to process.\n\nYou sound like you are meeting this head on, which is great.   \n\nI’m pretty sure you are going to need to go on hormone therapy at some point.   I was on hormones for three years, which got my PSA from 68 down to 0.05.   Since I came off the meds nearly 4 years ago my PSA has crept up and is now holding at 0.6 to 0.8, and looks like staying there for the foreseeable future. One more year and I will move from classified as ‘remission’ to ‘cured’!  Also, most of the side effects of the hormone therapy have completely resolved themselves, from weight gain and cancer brain to no more erectile dysfunction.  \n\n(If you’re on hormone therapy, big suggestion, join a gym, start lifting weights, and work as hard as your doctor says you can, it will help you hugely!)\n\nAs to your big question, experience vs positive outlook, that’s a toughie, because I was lucky enough to strike a doctor with both first up.  However you can do a lot to stay positive yourself.   A positive attitude helps so much, but also a doctor that will be brutally honest with you when you need to hear it is also a bonus.   I know that I had a couple of doctors who sugar coated some of the side effects that the medication was going to have on me, and I probably tried too hard to pretend I could carry on as normal when in reality I needed just one doctor to tell me that I needed to slow down and give myself and my soul some time to recover, especially during the radiation phase of my treatment.\n\nEach experience is going to be different, and I would suggest you go with the doctor that you trust the most and have a rapport with, but make sure that he or she will give you unvarnished truth when you ask the hard questions.   You may not get a cure, but there’s no reason to hope you wont.\n\nAfter the first 3 months of hormone treatment, my oncologist expected my PSA to drop from 68 down to somewhere between 15-25, when it dropped to 0.5, he asked for a retest because he was afraid that there had been a mistake in the lab.  The numbers were confirmed.  That’s when he told me that whatever I was doing, I should keep doing it, because he said that as far as he was concerned, I had won the lottery!  Miracles happen.  I hope you get yours too!', ""I'm sorry you're in this predicament at such a young age. I recommend, go to YouTube and look up the prostate cancer research institute. They just had an online symposium last weekend and all of the presentations are now online, on YouTube. Doctor Kwon from Mayo clinic had an excellent presentation, a couple of hours long, and there is a lot of very good information in it. It's important that you go to some kind of center of excellence, willing to treat you aggressively. All the best wishes."", 'Personally I agree with your choices.  I was lucky and had a RALP early enough to nip it in the bud but my wife had a different illness many years ago that was really life-threatening and after going through other specialists with whom she simply couldn’t establish a rapport, she found «\xa0Dr. Wonderful\xa0», with whom she immediately felt much more comfortable.  I can’t emphasize the difference that made in her recovery.  Maybe it’s just wishful thinking but I think that the body really does react better when the mind is comfortable.', ""go with the doc with the better bedside manner. reduced stress will go a long way with helping you recover.

It\'s better for him to be blunt than to say ""oh let\'s rip it out and you\'ll be fine,"" knowing you won\'t be.\n\nAll that being said rapport with your doctor is extremely important.  If you are not comfortable with your doctor you won\'t trust him.\n\nI cannot recall what hormone my hubby had (3rd injection soon).  It does cause side effects but it is better than the consequences of not doing it.   He went with radiation over an RALP.', ""Hey there. I am very new to all this, and in the lurking stages here. I noticed you are from Rhode Island- so am I!  I haven't been officially diagnosed yet (although all signs point to it).\n\nReach out if you need a local to talk to!"", 'There are a bunch of different types of hormone therapy medications - Lupron, Degarelix, Eligard, etc .... they all stop your body from producing testosterone. Testosterone feeds prostate cancer. So they essentially starve the the cancer and keep it in check for a while.  Lupron, one of the more common medications,  causes a surge in testosterone before it stops your body from producing it. The surge can cause the cancer to go nuts - but only briefly. Kinda like a one week feeding frenzy. Degarelix doesn\'t do this. With Degarelix there is no surge, your testosterone just plummets. My doctor didn\'t want me to undergo the surge because I was already having urinary problems. An influx in testosterone would have meant an increase in the pain that I was already having. Degarelix is injected into the belly fat and is uncomfortable. It\'s also more expensive. My doctor only gave me a single injection to bring my testosterone to zero before switching me over to the more common and ""pleasant"" butt-injected Lupron. With my testosterone at zero there would be no surge and no increase in pain.\n\nSorry for all the words! If you\'re not in pain the whole mix-and-match probably isn\'t necessary. Check with your doctor because I\'m definitely not one. \n\nTake care and feel free to contact me.\n\n- Scott', 'Being on the east-coast and not too far from NY look up dr Samadi one of the best!

Despite cleaning up my diet, and attempting low impact exercise, I feel myself getting weaker each month. My ability to focus on complex issues is also becoming affected. Although researching and reading others experiences, seems to indicate that others may choose to continue active surveillance, I am leaning towards having RALPS sooner than later. If I'm stronger now than I will be in a year or two, maybe I should pull the trigger now rather than continue with the sword of Damocles over head.

I went on AS for a year and a half and this caused constant low level anxiety.

Over the next few months my anxiety almost completely went away, especially since my PSA went down to 0.1. \n\nHowever, and this is a big one, the second radiation treatment resulted in prostate swelling, and complete retention. I went through horrible pain and my wife drove me to the ER. A nurse inserted a catheter and drained off 1200cc or urine. The pain went away, but I was in and out of the urology office for 6 weeks having catheters inserted and removed until the swelling went down and I could clear my bladder on my own. \n\nThree years later my prostate continued to grow and I had another operation (PAE) to reduce the size. It ""sort of "" worked for a year, and the only thing that helped me to urinate was Flomax. I then had a bipolar TURP operation and that worked - was able to urinate and got off the Flomax. \n\nThen, I developed ""radiation cystitus"" - my ladder became extremely sensitive to any urine present, and this kept/keeps me from getting a full night\'s sleep - up and down every few hours to go to the bathroom.\n\nIn retrospect, if I had it to do all over again, I would have had my prostate removed.

77,63 YO Prostate Removal Update Part 3,12,eo6947,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/eo6947/63_yo_prostate_removal_update_part_3/,9,"Well the most anxiety ridden event of my 63 years on earth has come and gone.  And I survived. And yes I made WAY too big a deal out of it. 

My catheter was removed earlier this morning.  Those preparing to go through this surgery I’ll walk you you through it. 

The catheter was the thing that creeped me out more than any other aspect of the surgery short term. I didn’t care about being put under or having holes punched in my belly or even putting up with constipation. But in reality it was not that big of a deal. I could walk around with it and shower and even went out with my wife and ran some errands a couple of times. But there were times when it would backflow or something and I would have the urge that I needed to pee. But I found if I walked around or made sure there was no fluid in the hose leading to the bag that helped. I was able to sleep at night but I never felt like it was a sound sleep. I slept on my back and tried to stay a bit propped up so I didn’t have that backflow issue as I am referring to it.

Honestly this morning was one of the top five most anxiety ridden events I’ve experienced in my 63 years. I understand that I was blowing it out of perspective but nevertheless it’s where I was and I was a truck speeding down the mountain out of control with my emotions. They called me back and the nurse explained what would happen. I took my pants and boxers off and then she had me lay down and then inserted a syringe into the port of the catheter. She told me to let her know when I had a sensation of needing to go. After about 30 seconds or so I said yes I could feel that I had to pee. She had me take a deep breath and blow it out and as I did she pulled the 5 feet in diameter hose out of my penis. OK maybe that’s an exaggeration. :-) It was over in a second or two and it didn’t hurt so much as just feel very odd. She then placed some sort of urine collection container over my penis and set me up and told me to pee as I normally would and left the room. I pee’d out the solution she had injected and while it was clear going in it came out a bit pink (from the blood I assume). She then did an ultrasound on my bladder to make sure I had not held anything extra.  She strongly suggested I wear the diaper gizmo home which I did and which I’m glad I did. I shifted once in the car seat and I could tell some urine had come out.

I realize I made the catheter situation much more difficult than it needed to be. As a rule, my personality is very low-key so this was not something I was used to feeling. In any event it’s gone!

As a side note, the biggest side effect I have had from this surgery was the constipation. They started me on softeners the afternoon after surgery. But nothing was happening several days in so I took some other laxatives. Still nothing. That became very uncomfortable yesterday and earlier this morning—going on 6 days. But once the catheter was removed I seem to be able to relax enough and that situation seems to be resolving itself.

I assume my next couple of hurdles will be bladder control and then erectile dysfunction management. I head in next week for a follow up with the doctor and then meet with a group at the hospital regarding the ED. This time last week I had no idea what to expect… Truly it has been a very positive experience. If any of you guys are questioning whether you should have surgery please don’t hesitate!

I've thought about posting this before, and either thought it wouldn't be helpful or just chickened out and deleted it. I am a 58 year old who was diagnosed Gleason 3+3 T1C almost a year ago. Currently in active surveillance. I am definately fighting depressive periods as I am walking through this journey. In spite of this, I am beginning to recognize the many blessings that I was unaware of. One of which is the fact that I have probably had low T for a long time, slowing down my progression. Even with this being the case, I have always been the one in my marriage with the higher libido. The truth be told, we have had a dead bedroom for a very long time. As I contemplate RALPS, doing kegals, pelvic floor therapy, exercise and other things, I just can't help but falling back to thinking whats the point. I do recognize on some level that this is ""stinkin thinkin"" but it sometimes makes me want to give up.

Kick its butt.', ""My thoughts on G6....OR You don't know what you don't know.\n\nG6 is a deceiving diagnosis.  I wrote this a few years ago when I was neck deep in studying my condition. \n\nAlthough TRUE G6 is not aggressive cancer, and some say it's not cancer at all (maybe pre-cancer) but the problem is that it is difficult (maybe impossible) to know the exact makeup of prostate cancer. \n\nPCa is not easily diagnosed with one test alone because the TRUE PATTERN of PCa is hard to distinguish and therefore to diagnosis.  With P3, it could take years of watching and waiting, or active surveillance to diagnose.\n\nTRUE G6 means TRUE pattern 3 (P3) only, and TRUE P3 never leaves the prostate, it does not metasticize, and you don't die from it..  TRUE P3 does not become P4 nor P5, it stays there within the prostate as P3, but it may take years to show it's real nature.\n\nThere are two reasons why it's hard to distinguish: \n(1) because they are only sampling the prostate; taking a small piece of the prostate to test.  They can and do miss the bad cancer, it's not tested. This is the current state of testing practice for prostate tissue.  \n(2) because the system used to measure pattern is not only subjective, it is indeterminate, at least for any pattern less than 5, and for a few years.  To understand this we need to understand the current system of diagnosing prostate cancer.  \n\nProstate pattern occurs on a pattern scale of 1 to 5, 1 is the least aggressive and 5 is the highest.  Until recently only P1 and P2 were thought to be the non-cancerous patterns, but it's recently determined that P3 also does not metasticize. Therefore many now consider TRUE P3 to be non-cancerous.\n\nThe problem is that metasticizing cancer can present as  P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 patterns.  When cancer presents as P5 , that is definitively highly aggressive cancer. When it presents as P4 that could be either aggressive-4 or highly aggressive cancer-5.  But when it presents as P3 that could be (a) non-metasticizing cancer-3, or (b) aggressive cancer-4, or (c) highly aggressive cancer-5.  P3, therefore, can indicate no problem, or a big problem, or a very big problem.  \n\nFor now, the only way to know, is wait and take another biopsy.  But waiting means taking the risk that P3 indicates non-metastatic cancer, when in fact its metasticizing, which may not be true.

81,UPDATE - 39yo with Gleason 9.,9,ntbmep,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/ntbmep/update_39yo_with_gleason_9/,3,"Since I've had plenty of people reaching out to me after previous posts, I figured I'd update everyone. Here's my big cancer story I posted earlier: https://old.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/n4vh6e/a_cautionary_tale_about_normal_psas_in_young_men/

I had my RP done 9 days ago. Overnight in the hospital and up and out the next day. The catheter really sucked but they were able to remove it on day 6, so that was nice. Continence has actually been awesome. Had a little leakage day one, but pretty much dry since then. And that's without really being able to use my pelvic floor muscles since they still feel like they've been hit with a truck. 

As for the pathology report, ended up with negative margins which was great. The seminal vesicle that was suspect on the MRI turned out to be negative. There were four positive nodes, which was a bummer but we were expecting at least one from the MRI so not a big surprise. Final staging was pT3a. They also downgraded the cancer to a gleason 9 (4+5) from the previous (5+4). 

The doc gave me two options, to either wait three months and evaluate the PSA or start Lupron. I said I want to be aggressive, so while I hate the idea of the hormones I chose the Lupron. I figured it was going to happen at some point so might as well get rolling right away. Haven't gotten the shot yet, but will be doing so soon. He also recommended some pelvic radiation in a few months once the area has healed from surgery.

So overall I'm pretty happy with how things turned out, so far. The doc gave me a pretty encouraging prognosis - 80-85% 10-15 year survival. I can live with that.",2021-06-06 02:35:26+00:00,"['Man, your story scares the hell out of me.

My dad was diagnosed with PC about two years ago. After discovering that his prostate was enlarged, PSA level initially was above 10, he had a biopsy and MRI; his Gleason score was 7 (3+4). Doctor said that he’s a good candidate for ‘close monitoring’. One year later, another MRI, showing no changes from the first, another biopsy and most recent PSA was 6...he was again given the same Gleason score of 7 (3+4). 
He is 61 years old. 
His urologist has not recommended treatment such as surgery or radiation, just surveillance. My family and I are concerned and think he should have it removed, but he won’t due to the side effects from surgery, which I understand can be significant. He has convinced himself that his PC is low grade, despite the results of several tests over two years. From what I’ve read, men with a Gleason above 6 are generally recommended to have some form of treatment. 
I am wondering...
What are the risks of simply monitoring his prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7? Are there alternative treatment options besides surgery and radiation? Is close monitoring actually safe in his case? Does he still have a good outcome if continues Active surveillance only?

 I am 50 with a family history of PS (Dad in his 60s when diagnosed) and in January my Dr. felt a lump doing a digital exam on my prostrate for my yearly physical. My PSA at the time was 3.3 which is the top percentage of normal.  Was sent to the Urologist who also did an exam and said he felt something and that he wanted me to get an MRI and then do a guided biopsy. He explained that it was 50/50 that it was cancer and I was told to lose my belly fat so that his job would be easier doing the surgery. I got on that and started a Mediterranean diet and exercises like Peloton and gym. I spoke with the Urologist after my MRI and the report said that I had two small lesions that were rated at PIRADS 5. From what I read this MRI reading meant I was about 90% likely to come back with a high Gleason score as they indicated in the report. I went for the guided biopsy last week and to be honest the enema and my nerves were way worse than the procedure. I got a call from the Urologist today with the results and it was Gleason 3 + 3 and we are going to do active surveillance.  I will get a PSA and digital exam in 3 months.  I was shocked to get that diagnosis given the findings in my MRI, but I guess I was in that 10% error margin that they have. I think I am happy with this, but I had pretty much surrendered to the fact that I was going to need surgery and get cancer out.  AS from what I read is the right thing to do and my PSA seems to respond appropriately to issues in my prostrate.

The journey through this has been mentally exhausting and I probably should have talked to a therapist or something during it to get some of what I was thinking in my head out in a rational way instead of the irrational way it seemed to come out. My point in this is that you really don't know what the results of the test are going to be until you actually get them. I had painted a picture in my head and it wasn't true. I still think that sometime down the road I will have to get my prostrate removed given the family history, but again I am using my busted crystal ball to try and predict something I have no way of knowing. People told me to be positive and to focus on the positive percentages of it being better than expected, but that isn't how I roll.

Another concern I have I forgot to mention. Shrinkage. How many of you experienced it with prostatectomy and did it return?

Thanks again everyone.",2021-04-25 02:02:09+00:00,"[""There are 2 areas of concern. #1 is atrophy - loss of girth. Thickness of the shaft, in particular, shrinks due to reduced blood flow to the penis. Many guys have ED after a prostatectomy. Your nerves won't signal blood to the penis to get an erection. The nerves hopefully will health enough to signal this process. Until then, you use a vacuum pump to pull blood into the shaft to create an erection. This therapy helps restore most, if not all, of your original size. I had my RALP 7 months ago. Most of my girth has returned, but natural erections have not. I still do vacuum pump therapy. Also, I do Trimix injections that creates enough blood flow for an erection. Together these have made a big difference.\n\n#2 is shorter penile projection. Many guys notice their penis doesn't stick out as far. The penis has not shrunk; however, it doesn't stick out as far because the urethra was shortened during the prostatectomy. The shortened urethra won't let the penis stretch out as far as it did before. The tension on the urethra can pull some of the bladder down into the empty area from the removal of the prostate. I lost about 0.5 inches in projection. This hasn't improved much, if at all. Thankfully I've been able to test my erections, using Trimix. Right now, I have enough length remaining to get the job done. \n\nHope this info helps. Good luck to you!"", ""Sorry for the larger print.

I started rehab early with the MSK program. But to put it all in perspective, sexual function is there and still improving, cancer is out and first PSA was undetectable!\n\nSince the nerves and particularly blood supply are compromised to some degree by prostate removal, shrinkage happens. It’s mostly a function of blood flow. Some penile arteries run directly through the prostate, particularly the pudendal accessory artery, and may be impossible to preserve. Definitely start rehab as soon as possible after surgery and try to regularly stimulate blood flow and erections. This can reduce or avoid the atrophy of erectile tissues. \n\n.', ""I agree that a lot will depend on blood flow. I started out with minimal loss during recovery.

I am slightly new to reddit but I wanted to post here to see if I could get any advice or suggestions on my fathers situation.

A little bit on the background situation is my father is currently 63 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 8 years ago and has had several operations/procedures done to try to cure his cancer early on however they never ended up being successful. For the past few years, he has been managing his cancer until it started spreading. It spread to his spine about 2 years ago and they treated it with chemo and radiation but the tumors kept coming back. This past November, he had to go for emergency surgery because the tumors were compressing some nerves, causing some pain and if he didn't do the surgery he could lose his ability to walk. We were under the impression that the surgery was to remove the tumors and get rid of the cancer in his spine and he would be back to managing his cancer with a long life expectancy ahead of him. Unfortunately, that was not the case, they did remove the majority of the tumors but the surgery was also so they could create space in order to radiate the tumors afterwards. The surgery went well but his recovery was VERY rough and he had a few complications afterwards and with the pandemic going on no one could go to the hospital with him, it made it impossible to get information from Doctors, communication was awful and it just complicated the situation even further but that is another story. Fast forward to December, 4 weeks after his surgery, his oncologist told him that he believes my father has about a month and a half left to live... It was the most heartbreaking news I have ever received and it didnt make sense and it crushed us that after everything he has been through he now only has a month left? However here we are in February and my dad is still alive and doing much better.

I realize doctors cannot be exact with their timelines and can just provide information based on their experience but he really seemed like he was on his deathbed at the time and really believed we only has about a month left with him. We also enrolled him in home hospice and since being enrolled, it feels like he has been ""cured"". He is eating again, walking on his own, doesnt need oxygen 24/7, etc.  I realize he is not cured but the doctor has no explanation as to what is going on or how much time he has left at this moment and basically has told him to just sit back and enjoy the time he has left. At first, my dad accepted this but now he wants to still try and fight this and stay with us for as long as possible. He became a grandfather in October (my sister had her first baby) and I am supposed to get married in September so I think those things have given him reasoning to try and fight and be here as long as he can.

He is starting to take casadex and will continue with lupron shots every 3 months and has looked into a few trials to see if he could get into one as well. He just doesnt want to try something that will make him feel shitty if he truly only has a few weeks or months left unless whatever he were to try is guaranteed to extend his life significantly. 

Basically, what I am wondering is if anyone has experienced a situation like this? or has an idea of what we should expect and can provide some guidance? or does anyone have suggestions as to treatment options he should look into?

Im sorry this is so long, I tried to condense it as much as possible and I appreciate any advice/input/suggestions.

98,3 Weeks Post Surgery,9,k6za3p,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/k6za3p/3_weeks_post_surgery/,18,"Hi all. I had a robot (Da Vinci) assisted radical prostatectomy on Friday the 13th of November 2020. All I need now is to catch COVID-19 to make it the perfect no good, terrible, very bad 2020 experience. 

I’m 66 and my prostate was behaving itself until I had my annual physical last June. I had no particular symptoms but my PSA which had been 2.5 trending to 3.5 in the last 10 years was suddenly 5.3.  

I was referred to a very good urologist who, after a quick exam said I needed the PSA rechecked in 3 months. So in September, PSA is now 8.9. We discussed the various options but decided it needed a biopsy to know what was going on. 

Two weeks later, the pathology results were 2 cores positive  - a Gleason 3+4 and a 3+3 bilaterally and next to my bladder. Again, we discussed options, but I didn’t want this time bomb ticking away inside me and wanted it out!  

So after a 6 week or so wait to allow my rectum to recover from the biopsy procedure, I had it removed. The post-op pathology confirmed the Gleason scores.  My lymph nodes, seminal vesicles and margins were clear, But during the procedure, my Dr also observed some invasion into the neck of my bladder and excised that with a good, clean margin. 

I’m now recovering well from the surgery and very hopeful the cancer is 100% removed. The incontinence is annoying, but it’s a bit better each day and I’m hopeful I’ll get control back in the next couple of months. 

My advice to everyone in this position: the biopsy is not as terrifying as one might think. It’s uncomfortable but not painful. There is no good reason to put it off. The Da Vinci procedure is nerve sparring and I didn’t need major painkillers after my one night in hospital - OTC Advil for the first 5 days kept me comfortable. 

I’ll have my first post-op PSA in early January 2021 and let y’all know how it goes.",2020-12-05 02:30:27+00:00,"[""Got my psa after surgery results.  0.0. I'm happy and I'm not incontinent .

I Want to follow up on my first post. 

I just got the results of my biopsy back and found out I do have prostate cancer. 

The doctor explained it, and I’m at middle level and it needs to be removed. So, going to start preparing for that in late November/early December. 

I’m not too worried about it (except for the sexual dysfunction possibility). So, I’m going into it pretty positive because of all the support I’ve gotten from everyone I’ve talked to about it. 

The surgery will be robotic and it will be successful and they will do their best to minimize any complications or negative side effects. Just keep going to the gym and get as fit as possible before hand!

When a man has his prostate removed, all of these parts are removed and he no longer produces semen, but when he has an orgasm his muscles still contract in the same way.

106,Looks like my dad might have prostate cancer and I need some advice,10,fq36mz,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/fq36mz/looks_like_my_dad_might_have_prostate_cancer_and/,15,"Hey all, I'm about to dump a wall of text here, if you just want the questions, they'll be at the end of the post :)

My Dad (60) got his MRI results back today which showed that he has a ""shadow"" on his prostate. He's had two blood tests which came back with PSA scores of 32 and 30 respectively. I'm aware that these are often inaccurate, but from my limited knowledge those are both very high scores.

The doctor called him today to let him know that the results are in and that they can see a shadow on his prostate. When he asked about his options, they said that they could start hormone therapy right away, but didn't seem keen on a biopsy because of COVID-19. It's worth noting that my dad does have asthma, so he's already considered ""vulnerable"" to Coronavirus. My dad replied that he would like a biopsy because he needs to know the result, to which the doctor responded ""okay that's your call, we can get you booked in for an appointment next Wednesday"".

He didn't get any more information from the Doctor. He doesn't know anything about the hormone treatment. He doesn't know how effective it is, he doesn't know whether being on hormone therapy will delay him getting a biopsy down the line,  he doesn't even really know what it does, and none of us really know whether he made the right call.

I really feel like the doctor should have gave him the information he needs to make an informed decision about the steps to take going forward. It's partially my dad's fault for not asking more questions, but I can't really blame him given that he was just told that there's a good chance that he has cancer and gave him an on-the-spot decision to make.

I've suggested that we take the weekend to find out as much as we can about his options and then call back on Monday to cancel the biopsy and start hormone treatment if needs be.

My questions are:

\- How effective is the hormone therapy at delaying the spread of cancer? If it's advanced, does its effectiveness change?

\- Are people with prostate cancer at increased risk if they do catch Coronavirus?

\- Is it a good idea to get the biopsy now before the coronavirus situation gets even worse?

\- How much information are the doctors likely to know at this stage? Would the MRI have shown if the cancer had spread? If he was on the brink of death, would the be able to determine that from an MRI? I thought that the fact they didn't get him in for an urgent biopsy was possibly good news but that may be me being optimistic.

So I would ask a lot more questions and, if possible, get a second opinion before doing anything. \n\nYour father's PSA is quite elevated, but without knowing how aggressive the cancer is and whether or not it has already spread beyond the prostate, jumping right to hormone therapy seems premature--hormone therapy is usually prescribed after surgery or radiation has failed or if the doctors believe the cancer has already spread beyond the prostate. \n\nHormone therapy can be very effective at slowing the growth of prostate cancer, but (other men here likely have personal experience with it they could share) it also has side-effects that can be unpleasant. I don't know if the hormone therapy itself could make your father at higher risk from COVID, but it is something I would want to know before I started taking it.\n\nIt sounds like (and again, this is a less-than educated guess) the doctor is prescribing hormone therapy now because of COVID--that he is trying to slow the growth of the cancer in order to buy some time for the pandemic to pass, at which point he would (I'm guessing) go through the more standard protocol of getting a biopsy (he cannot know how aggressive the cancer may be without doing that), and/or a PET scan. \n\nSo I would ask the doctor on Monday and then I would seek a second opinion. It may be more difficult at this time, but there should be no reason you can't have your father's file sent to another urologist/oncologist so that you can hear what he or she has to say. I know the impulse is to act immediately, but it does not seem to me that your father's case is so urgent he needs to start treatment without taking a little time to be certain that he's making a good, informed decision.\n\nBest of luck to you both."", ""I totally agree with /u/cranky_old_fuck.

Very effective. This would buy months and months of time. HOWEVER, this may significantly impact the results of the biopsy.

Probably not for most, unless they have widespread metastatic disease.\n3. This is one of those rare situations where doing to biopsy probably makes sense.

They essentially know nothing other than elevated PSA and a lesion (PIRADS 4 or 5 I assume) on the MRI. This is very suggestive, but not diagnostic.

So ,I do have PC. But, it is early stage and thankfully I have several choices of different modalities I can choose from But, each modality has it own risks. Each different Doctor says their treatment is best. Thoughts? Thanks",2020-03-17 03:40:51+00:00,"[""Everything is a trade-off. Do you care more about the cancer being gone, or do you care more about how the treatment will impact your quality of life?  \n\nIf you are doing Brachytherapy alone (No external beam) there is evidence that it provides better quality of life outcomes. You'll have a better chance of maintaining erectile function than external beam radiation or RP. Even with nerve sparing surgery there is a significant chance that you will suffer from erectile dysfunction. The trade-off is that there is also evidence of a slightly higher rate of progression in brachytherapy patients. Statically slightly worse cancer control, but slightly better QOL. \n\nIf you go the surgical route, after your surgery you will know fairly quickly if your cancer has been cured. Pathology performed on the prostate will show if any cancer remained at the margins of the resection, and a post operative PSA test after surgery is easy to interpret--it will be undetectable if the surgery was a success. With radiation it's a bit more wishy-washy since you still a prostate you still have a PSA value, and since ADT is often done concurrently with radiation now, you won't know for a while if the treatment was a success or not, and recurrence is harder to determine.  \n\nIf you have recurrence, you may be able to have surgery after brachytherapy but its not common. However you can certainly have curative radiation after surgery. So in case of recurrence you do have a second bullet to fire. With that said, the success rate of salvage radiation is not great so its a bit of a shitty bullet.\n\n\nUnfortunately, you just have a set of crappy options and you'll have to decide which crappy option you hate the least."", 'Good question. I personally went with surgery based on sampling of people I\'ve known with similar levels and profile.  I know it isn\'t scientific.  \n\nTime will tell if surgery was the right decision.

But that is perhaps an easier choice for me at my age.  I want to live longer and hopefully cancer-free, so ED, while obviously a nuisance, is not going to alter my life as dramatically as it might for younger men  (I am also blessed with an understanding wife and I\'m pretty sure we will find some workaround).  Brachytherapy (or ""Curiethérapie"" as it is known here; I am a US expat in France) is popular here but my urologist really feels that I have a good chance of eliminating the cancer for good if I go for the surgery.  So off I go.', ""One thing to consider is that radiation after surgery is very doable. Surgery after radiation, not so much. There are a very few doctors who will try it, and I'm sure they will get better at it. But two years ago when I had to make the decision it was part of the reason I chose surgery. \n\nI was also young--just turned 50. Surgery is easier on the young, and it is possible (although not guaranteed) that side effects (ED and incontinence) will get better over time. Radiation, on the other hand, has long term health risks and while you may avoid side-effects in the short run, my understanding is that you may still side effects, just many years down the road. So, for me it made more sense to get surgery at a young age, and save radiation in case I needed it later. Also, I wanted to avoid other risks from so much radiation at a young age (i.e., secondary cancers).\n\nFinally, surgery is the only way to know precisely how bad the cancer is. Your 3+4 could very well be a 4+4, but since a biopsy only captures small samples of the cancer, you may never know. Depending on your personality (how risk averse you are) this may not matter to you. It did to me. I need to know. So I went with RP. \n\nThis is a very personal decision; so whatever you decide, the most important thing (I think) is that you are comfortable that you made the right choice. The outcome is unknowable, but you don't want to be second-guessing yourself for the rest of your life afterwards if things don't turn out the way you hoped. I, for instance, developed side effects I did not anticipate. Still, knowing what I knew at the time, I am comfortable knowing I made the right choice for me. So while I sometimes regret the side-effects, I do not beat myself up about making the wrong choice. I made the best decision for me with the information I had. That, I think, is the best you can do. \n\nGood luck to you.""]",108

So I’m about 3 weeks removed from surgery and it’s going amazingly well. I had my pathology follow up this past Wednesday and I’m officially cancer free. :) 

I’ve had no real side effects, at least negative ones. I still wear a pad but other than a sneeze here or an odd movement there which has caused a quick drip I’ve been dry.  An interesting positive side effect has been my urinating. It shoots out of me like a fire hose!  

After the pathology meeting I met with an erection therapist nurse (male). They’ve started me on 25 mg dose of viagra before bedtime. Then the 7th day I’ll take 100 mg (whole pill) and should initiate sexual activity. Ok—if I HAVE to! ;) We also discusses the injection option should Viagra not work. We’ll see. 

Lastly I still have my libido. I thought maybe I’d lose it but not at all. My wife, who’s been amazing through all of this (we’re closer than ever) wanted some sexy times this afternoon which I’ve encouraged. I participated some but certainly was mostly passive. However I did achieve an erection of about a 5-6 on a scale of 10 with no viagra and only 3 weeks removed from surgery. So that was encouraging.

It was supposed to be nerve-sparing DaVinci surgery.   There were complications.   I honestly didn't think I'd miss ejaculation and since I'm too old to father children, that wouldn't be a problem either.  I have been in a relationship with my better half since 2004.  She didn't sign up for this and could have taken a walk but didn't.  I was in shock for some time after I recovered from my surgery.  Obviously, I'm sterile now and we both expected that so that wasn't a problem.   However, I didn't think that I would be impotent  We tried the pills like Cialis and Viagra with no luck.   I had just begun trying injections and they were having no effect either.   My partner was very supportive but we haven't had sex since the surgery.   I began masturbating while watching porn after about six months.  I can reach orgasm sometimes but I don't get an erection until AFTER orgasm which makes no sense to me. 

&#x200B;

On September 11th of this year, I made my eight-year anniversary of that surgery.  We stopped talking about the surgery or the after-effects about six months after the surgery in 2011.  I'm ready to talk but not sure what she'll say or do about it.    The doctors were no help in getting us to understand the ramifications of the surgery.   The surgeon had no answers when the impotence started.   Last year, we moved from Illinois to Iowa and I have a new doctor.  I have not talked with him about this issue either.  I am terrified of getting an implant as I've seen pictures from those who got one.  

&#x200B;

I can reach orgasm maybe four of every seven days.  My partner and I even stopped being intimate in all ways.  She is going through mental issues of her own.   She has agoraphobia and complex PTSD so that is making things harder.   I want to ask my doctor to send me to a urologist so we can try the injections again and see if that will help.

120,Father (57) In Agony Several Days After Laparoscopic Prostatectomy.,7,mqkj9j,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/mqkj9j/father_57_in_agony_several_days_after/,7,"(Edited for corrections, spelling, and grammar)

Hello, I'm posting here because I don't know what I should be doing, and I can't find any additional resources from people who are going through similar symptoms as my father.

My father was diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer in April of last year. The cancer was apparently moving slowly and had been for years, so when the Coronavirus hit the US, his surgery was delayed until just last week, Wednesday the 7th. He received a laparoscopic (robotic) prostatectomy in which the entirety of his prostate was removed. According to the surgeon, the surgery went well, and after spending a day and a half in the hospital after the surgery, he was released home with a foley catheter and a JP surgical drain. 

Here is where the trouble begins:
Due to a miscommunication between my grandmother (who was picking up my father from surgery) and the doctor, my father's prescription for pain medication (325 acetaminophen and 5 hydrocodone) was NOT picked up. My father was on no pain medication the 2nd day after his surgery. He was able to walk around the house with a walker with some mild discomfort, but he could not sit or lie down without experiencing agonizing, tear-inducing pain. The only position that receives any modicum of pain is standing up. The pain was so extreme that I called 911 the night he came home from the surgery. Unfortunately, the paramedics would not bring my father to the ER of the hospital he had the surgery in, only a nearby hospital's ER. 

While at that ER, they gave him a dose of something that allowed him to sleep for about 45 minutes. The doctor came in just as he was coming out of sleep, and said that we should follow up with the doctor who performed the surgery in the morning. 

So I took him back home, and he was already in excruciating pain as he gets into the car. When we got home, he spent the next five hours standing, in extreme discomfort, leaning over a counter to try to get some rest standing up. 

By 5 AM on Friday, I was able to get ahold of the doctor who performed the surgery, and I explained the situation. I also explain his catheter isn't filling at the rate that he's ingesting fluids, and that got his attention. He tells us to come to the ER where the surgery was performed, and he would meet us there.

An agonizing car ride across two cities to get to the hospital later, and we're there. He's in complete and udder agony, moaning and crying in pain. This ER gives him something for the pain, a CT scan is done, the doctor comes in and looks at my dad, checks the CT scan and says it looks good, rearranges the catheter line a bit, and leaves. He told us that he's adding on (5 mg of Oxycodone) to the prescription as well, and to get it filled as soon as we leave. We left, filled the prescription, and I gave it to him immediately.

Coming home, still under the effect of the hospital's drugs and the painkillers he was prescribed, he could lie down for about 45 minutes and get some sleep. Once that period was over, he was back to standing as the only comfortable position. I called the doctor and let him know the pain medication doesn't seem to be really affecting it, and he tells me to give him a larger dose, more often. This, again works briefly, as he was able to sit down somewhat comfortably for a bit, and even lie down for about 2 hours of sleep. 

By 2 AM of Saturday, the pain was back, and even the higher doses more frequently were not alleviating his pain, it was excruciating. It's another night of him in pain, hunched over a countertop while standing. By 6 AM I was able to get ahold of the doctor again, and I explained that the pain pills aren't touching his pain. He tells us to bring him back to the hospital, and they'll admit him and figure it out. 

We brought him back to the hospital, he's admitted, and they say his pain is a combination of the surgery, and an ileus. They begin weaning him off painkillers to try to restart his bowel. I left that night.

Sunday, he is still in extreme pain. His O2 stats drop and he is briefly admitted to ICU, although they are quickly stabilized, and he is transferred to ICU-step down. There at the ICU step down, they insert an NG tube (nasogastric tube) and remove four entire containers of fluid from my father's bowel, although that does not relieve the pain in any noticeable way, he was still in extreme pain.

Monday morning I joined him again. The NG continues to pull out about one container of fluid from his bowel for the day. However, his pain has not been affected at all. Around the afternoon he passes gas (a big fart) which is good news, apparently. Before I leave for the night, they perform another CT scan to make sure ""everything is where it should be."" He allegedly has a bowel movement after I am gone, but I was not able to follow up with his night nurse to confirm it.

Tuesday morning, he is in extreme pain again and is highly distressed. After being in the hospital for four days with no pain relief, he does not believe the doctor's claims of improvement, and believes the nursing staff is incompetent. The doctors say the CT scan came back clear, that there was a small amount of urine at the catheter site that could be contributing to the pain, in addition to the surgery itself and the ileus, but no further surgery is required at this point. His extreme pain continued throughout the day, and he has nearly filled another container of fluid from his NG tube. He has a machine that lets him self-administer Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) every ten minutes. We have entered a pattern where he awakes in absolute agony, he administers the Dilaudid, it takes about ten minutes to work. He falls asleep for approximately 20 minutes, he awakes in pain again, and the cycle repeats itself. 

It's now just before 11 PM as I write this, unsure of why. I don't understand if he's ""getting better"", why the pain is still so bad. Why aren't they giving him stronger pain medication so he can sleep for longer? 

I feel so alone, so helpless, and terrified for my father.

Please. If you have any idea what could be causing this, or if you or someone you know went through something similar, please tell me. I don't know what to do.

(4/15 UPDATE)

Hello again, I wanted to update everyone on my father's current condition and outlook. Firstly, I'd like to thank you for your comments and words of support, they really helped me get through a hard time. 

My father's current condition is stable, and his pain is being managed to the point where he is sleeping in small intervals regularly, without the constant application of painkillers. To elaborate briefly on the kind of pain he was experiencing, to the best he could articulate, it was deep in his belly, and felt ""like he got run over by a truck"" or ""Got kicked in the balls"" in his own words. I take that to mean a constant pain, localized to his stomach.

I got a chance to speak to his primary doctor in charge of my father's care the morning after I made this initial post, and several times after. Here are some of his answers to my questions:

1. My father's life is not in danger. What he's experiencing is an unfortunate but common post-surgical complication for someone of his weight (Over 250 lbs) and the size of the prostate. 

2.The pain he's experiencing is a combination of surgical trauma, and bruising of his bowels. The only way to really treat this, is to manage his pain conservatively with painkillers while the swollen bowel naturally repairs and restarts.

3. The doctor still expects him to make a full recovery, par some sexual function, which is natural when the tumor has grown so large, and the surgery was performed late in life. 

Now an update on his current status. I won't go into as much detail as my main posts, as this thread is long enough.

Currently, he is in stable condition, and seems to be doing much better, compared to two days ago (Despite a very aggravating error that resulted in my father's pain medication being cut off by a different doctor after I left, resulting in last night being absolutely miserable for him). 

He's since been given a new medication, but his pain levels have been the lowest they've been in a long time, and he is not administering the pain medication as nearly as often. He's been able to sleep without the assistance of pain medication, which is a huge improvement compared to the last few days. 

They have also removed the NG tube, and upgraded him to a clear diet. He's been taking things slow, and has some hiccups, but hasn't been vomiting. So far today he's had three bowel movements, each pretty large in volume compared to the two others he had in the last few days. 

The doctor says if he performs well tomorrow he'll consider upgrading him to solid diets, and ransitioning to oral painkillers. 

Overall, it seems like he's made a major improvement. I don't want to get too ahead of myself, but things are currently looking up.",2021-04-14 06:09:42+00:00,"['Well, as someone who had the same surgery in October I can say this is definitely not a typical scenario.

Again, this is obviously posted a lot by other members but I just found out today that my dad has been diagnosed with Prostate Cancer (PIRADS score was 4, and his Gleason Score is a 7).

His PSA levels rose from 6 to 12 over the past 12 months and has just gone in for a bone scan today. We find out more about the grade of the cancer on Thursday. I love my old man and he is a gentle soul, it pains me to hear that this has happened to him at a relatively young age so to speak.

I'm remaining positive though as Prostate Cancer seems fairly curable if it has localized and its a rather slow spreading cancer. He is a little scared of the repercussions of each treatment and obviously the end decision is up to him, but I am wanting to ask if there are any people here who have gone through surgery/radiation, and the justifications of why you chose the path you did.

The doctor he is seeing has recommended as prostatectomy (forgive me if the spelling is wrong) but this obviously is almost guaranteed to lead to impotence and or incontinence.

Some of us had better results than others, regardless of which therapy we chose, and for better or worse, we have to live with the results. We can all forever worry about a recurrence. We can all fret about which side effects might still await us. We can beat ourselves up for not choosing a different approach if we don't like our results, but this ignores the fact that we don't know if an alternative might have been even worse.

I’m still piecing everything together as my parents haven’t had regular health checks for years and the only reason we found out was because last week, he went to the ER for severe chest pain, and after all the scans, they were suspicious that he might have cancer. He said his PSA is 5500, should be 600, and that his cancer has spread to his lymph nodes but not to the bones. He is in a lot of pain in his chest, I’m still not sure if that’s caused by the cancer. 

The only thing I know is that he’s getting 1-2 shots at the start of the new year and he will consider treatment depending on what his insurance can cover.

Like I said, my parents haven’t kept up with their health for years (as far as going to the doctor) and I’m not sure how I can help him with what I’m sure is going to be an uphill climb. I don’t think they have wills, or any of their things in order as it pertains to all of that. My parents have had a shitty hand dealt in life with jobs (my dad has had tons of misc. entry-level jobs since I was a teenager) and they never felt like they could afford doctors, medicine, preventative care, etc. It’s not for lack of trying. I’m also worried about my mom - she has no way to support them financially and has largely relied on my dad for most things. 

Sorry for the long post, this is my first go around with cancer and I’m just looking for support or any suggestions as to what I can do for him and my mom so he can get the care he needs.",2020-12-23 20:03:53+00:00,"[""So sorry to hear this.

Any advice appreciated!,7,j5nx2b,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/j5nx2b/dad_has_prostate_cancer_now_need_to_take_a_crash/,21,"I just found out my 65 year old dad has prostate cancer. It came out of nowhere although ny dad has been monitoring his PSA level for the last year (news to me). I know nothing about this cancer and don't know where to start. My dad is also in shock and doesn't even know how to explain what the doctor told him (he went to get his results alone).

This is what I got directly from his report:

- Gleason score 6 (3,3) PSA 6

- Number of positive sites and cores 11/12

- % involvement in most extensively involved core 40%

He has a bone test and ct scan booked in a few weeks. His specialist says either radiation or operation while his family doctor suggests observation treatment, testing psa every 3-6 months. That seems like a long time in-between tests... Is that typical? 

Where do we go from here? I know it's not as bad as it could be yet... But the unknown is what's scary right now. My dad usually looks to me for guidance but i don't want to give him an uninformed opinion. Any resources, links, helpful advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",2020-10-05 17:37:24+00:00,"['Hi there.  \n\nFirst of all, do not panic (that goes for him as well as you).  Gleason score of 6 is right on the borderline; some urologists will recommend ""watchful waiting"" (i.e., do another PSA test in six months or so and see if it has increased) and others will recommend beginning treatment now : neither approach is incorrect and each has its adherents (although the fact that 11 out of 12 samples test positive would make me lean more towards beginning treatment).\n\nThey are right to ask for a bone test and CT scan: the important question here is whether the cancer is confined to the prostate cavity (in which case surgery is an option) or has moved out to nearby bone (in which case other treatments, such as androgen deprivation and/or radiation might be better).\n\nAs others have said, prostate cancer grows slowly and it is not unusual at all to wait months before determining what treatment (if any) is indicated, and little is lost by waiting.\n\nMost importantly, though : **prostate cancer is eminently treatable; a diagnosis of prostate cancer is not a death sentence**.  I was diagnosed at age 67, had the surgery six months later and according to all indications I am now cancer free (PSA indiscernible, i.e., less than 0.01).  The real issue at that stage becomes the secondary effects of treatment.  If the cancer is confined to the prostate cavity, many men will opt for surgery and the main problem is dealing with urinary incontinence (which usually tapers off after some time: some lucky men never have it, some for a few months, some for a longer time period - in my case it is finally beginning to slow down seven months after surgery, but most men see improvement earlier) and erectile dysfunction (a tougher nut to crack, if you will excuse the pun; it can take six months to two years to see real progress).\n\nIf you want more background, I highly recommend the book by Patrick Walsh (you can download it from most eBook platforms and it costs about fifteen bucks).  Knowledge is power here.\n\nBest of luck to him and to you.', 'Read more before you do anything!!   Gleason 6 is not considered ""cancer"" by many experts.  Certainly most will say surgery would be ridiculous right now.  Most would say observation is the route to go.  \n\nThere is a wonderful FB group on nonsurgical treatment of prostate cancer with lots of recommendations.\n\nMy husband had Gleason 8 and had radiation.', '[deleted]', 'Good on you for looking to get informed.  In men of your fathers age, prostate cancer is usually less agressive, and the bone/ct scan will be the best indicator of how he is going to progress.  The advice you have already received is pretty sound.  I had a Gleason 8 and PSA of 68 with a grade 3 tumour, diagnosed at the young age of 47.  Treated with radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.  (7 weeks radiation in the middle of 3 years of ADT), been in remission for 3 years post treatment now, PSA is now 0.8.  The side effects of ADT were pretty rough though.  Most of them have resolved themselves.', ""Lots of good advice here. Take some time to thoroughly explore all your options. Get a second opinion on the biopsy, most of the large cancer centers offer an expert evaluation at a reasonable cost. Johns Hopkins has an excellent reputation. Another opinion might either downgrade or upgrade the Gleason score as well as other characteristics that might be relevant. In any case you'll have more of the basic information to help define treatment options. For me a Gleason 7 was redefined as 9 and intraductal as well. None of that was good news, but it completely changed my thinking about which direction to go. \n\nGather as much information as possible. Since the how and why of prostate cancer is not understood, much of the information will be statistical. It may apply to you, or it may not. Everyone's cancer is different in ways that impact your decisions. So find out as much as you can. The time doctors have to focus on your dad's case will be limited, so be your own advocate. By all means read through Patrick Walsh's book. Ask many questions. Radiologists will often recommend radiation, surgeons can lean toward a surgical solution. Scans will give insights into your specific situation. If a 3T MRI can be had, all the better. If you can afford it, UCLA now offers a PSMA PET scan for about $2800. Unfortunately, even though these scans have been used in Germany and Australia for the better part of a decade, here they are still considered experimental, so no insurance coverage. The PSMA scan is roughly equivalent to a bone scan, in that it shows biological activity, only with much greater resolution.  \n\nSomeone above mentioned genetic testing. Germline testing is a fairly inexpensive saliva test and can offer some insights,  for example BRCA genetic abnormalities can indicate whether some of the newer immunotherapies would be helpful(though these would be systemic therapies more applicable to cancer that has already metastasized and it sounds as if your dad's is still localized). The other type of genetic testing is based on analysis of the cancer biopsy itself. This is more expensive and might or might not yield useful information. Again, the more information and the more specific and personal the information, the better.\n\nAsk for a monthly PSA test. Some months there may be little change, some a lot. If your dad is making adjustments in terms of supplements, diet and excercise, he may get some valuable feedback about what is helpful over time.\n\nFor me the diagnosis was more a bucket of icewater than a tap on the shoulder and the new reality takes some recalibration. Being proactive has been a key for me."", 'Did he get MRI targeted or is it just a standard TRUS biopsy?  If it wasn’t targeted then 11/12 cores positive indicates he has either a giant tumour or many tumours inside his prostate. Although GS6 typically have good prognosis. The fact that it’s very large can be concerning. \n\nThe vast majority of GS6 patients do not require treatment as treating a low grade cancer is sometimes worse due to morbidity associate with treatment such as incontinence and impotence. \n\nHowever such a large tumour may be the exception. You should consult a urologist and radiation oncologist for different opinions on what your next steps should be. 65 is still relatively young for prostate cancer. Hopefully he’ll have many years left with you.', 'https://imgur.com/a/2s7m7CC\n\nHe is low risk. HOWEVER, if he is healthy I would likely categorize him as a personalized favorable intermediate risk and would recommend treatment. The number of cores involved predicts higher likelihood that he may harbor unrecognized grade group 2 (3+4) and I would view him as increased risk for progression. While technically a candidate for active surveillance, few of my colleagues (and certainly not myself) would advocate active surveillance (again - if he is healthy).\n\nSecond point, per NCCN guidelines, there is no indication for bone scan nor CT and is an inappropriate use of staging studies.', 'I am 61, was diagnosed in November, 2019 and had a radical prostatectomy in February 2020.  Lots of good advice here. I had a couple of thoughts.  First, in some ways, the PSA level is not as important as how quickly it escalated to that number.  Second, a Gleason 6 is something to pay attention to.  If it were me, depending on how swiftly your dad’s PSA has increased, I’m thinking he  might want to check it every three months. Finally, the choice between radiation (and that family of options) versus surgery, is important.  Generally speaking, surgery is for younger guys, like your dad, who have a lot of time to recover from the relatively short term side effects of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. I say “relatively” because those side effects of surgery can last a while.  Usually the urinary incontinence clears up with two or three months. The ED is much more difficult to predict.  But, as I understand it, while the impact of the radiation family of treatment doesn’t have the immediate negative side effects of surgery, those functions degrade and continue to degrade over time. They don’t get better. Also, if your dad undergoes radiation treatment, it is my understanding that he is very unlikely to be a candidate for surgery in the future.

130,Dry orgasm of my husband,7,hq4nhd,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hq4nhd/dry_orgasm_of_my_husband/,13,"Hello  you!  A long time ago I had made you a post to inform me about the  functions of the prostate because my new husband had radical  prostatectomy and during our first sexual intercourse he had had a  discomfort.

I  took a long time to write you the continuation because I do not go  often on this site but the week after that we started to get closer and I  told him about our first time when I had masturbated him...  I told him  that I had read and that I did not know that a man without a prostate  could not ejaculate, I asked him if he was in pain at the time.  Then he  explained everything to me what you explained to me here, he admitted  to me that he was uncomfortable the last time because he had not told me  exactly, prostatectomy is not like a vasectomy and he is no longer able  to ejaculate like a normal man after this surgery and that I didn't  seem to know.  He felt his orgasm was approaching and didn't want to  surprise me with it.  I am the first woman who has been in a  relationship with him since his surgery and he sees himself different  from other men because of this.  I told him that I accept that, he  doesn't have to be bothered by that and that he is a man even if he no  longer ejaculates.

Following this  discussion I started to masturbate him again and he took great pleasure  with a good erection like a normal man, at one point he started to have  liquid that came out of his penis he warned that his orgasm was near and  I told him to let go not to be shy.  He then replied with a smile that I  will not be sprayed with him...  It was a bit of a discovery for me, I  felt several very powerful spasms in his penis and as you explained  nothing to me came out at this moment, It is as if the muscles are  working to expel the semen but there is none. It seemed strange to me at  the beginning of not seeing the semen come out of a penis at this time  but it took a lot of pleasure anyway, his orgasm seems to last longer  and very satisfying. It was very exciting for me to see him take  pleasure even if he no longer ejaculates.

From  my point of view, I am a girl whose ejaculation did not bother me and I  appreciated them, my ex had good ones.  I never thought that a man  could not ejaculate before meeting this older man who had prostate  cancer.  How your penis and ejaculation work is a lot more complex than I  thought and I admire the men who have gone through this disease, it  must be diffucult.  I gave you the details from my women point of view  and my new husband is doing quite well after 5 years in urinary control  and erections.  For the loss of ejaculation, after seeing my husband's  dry orgasm in front of me and under my hands control, I understand that  some of you are concerned about this aspect. It is still very different  for men and women but it is something that we have to adapt fairly  quickly and the pleasure is still present anyway.  Sex has now become  very clean without ejaculation and no need to think about contraception.

131,Three weeks since surgery: Experience so far,7,guer3a,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/guer3a/three_weeks_since_surgery_experience_so_far/,33,"Hi Folks,

New club member here. I had a robotic prostatectomy 3 weeks ago. When surgery was getting close and I was getting really anxious, questions and comments from users like /u/ohiocoalman, /u/dynobat, /u/amerkanische_Frosch and others really helped inform my expectations, and I wanted to thank everyone who was willing to post about their experience. THANK YOU! I figured it was only fair to add my experience to the sub. I feel kind of crappy using an ALT but my daughter and I post art and crafts with my main and I don't want a kid clicking on our username and ending up here.

My journey started in OCT 2017 at 51 when a PSA test returned a result of 3.02. Over the next couple years, I got results of 4.4, 4.9, 4.4, 3.0, 3.5, 3.8. At the end of 2018 I had a biopsy. It was weird; not super painful; the recovery from it wasn't too bad; I remember thinking that I could handle this again fairly easily. One node of my biopsy was positive and a later MRI didn't show anything abnormal. Here things felt just a bit surreal, but without any close experience with cancer, it didn't feel serious. At the end of 2019, I had another biopsy. This one was a lot bloodier and much more painful and the recovery was a bit worse. I was pretty sure I didn't ever want to do this again. Two nodes of my biopsy were positive with a gleason score of 6 and abnormalities showed up on my MRI. It still didn't hit me fully; I didn't use the word cancer and I didn't think about it much.

Things moved fast from here. I got handed one of those 100 questions about prostate cancer books, which I read, but it felt useless. Then I found this subreddit and thoughts and ideas started getting real and I started to feel like I needed to take this more seriously.

Initially I didn't love my surgeon. He seemed stoic; not uncaring, but he struggled to be empathetic. He gave me a lot of info and asked me for questions. But I never felt like I knew what to ask, or maybe it was that this subreddit was already answering a lot of my questions. I went through the motions of talking with oncologists, nurses, etc. to figure out which path to take. I'm married with a 10 year old daughter and I'm pretty interested in sticking around with them, so I settled on surgery because I felt like it was my best chance at getting the crap out of my system, to heck with the potential side effects. During every step of the way to make this decision, I'd always ask what the doc or nurse thought of my surgeon because I might start ""interviewing"" others, and each time someone would tell me how my surgeon was great, meticulous, cared so much about each of his patients, etc. It really surprised me. After this, I went back to his own nurse and discussed my concerns and he told me he heard that from other patients too, but he gave me a laundry list of why I should stick with him. After more research, I decided to stick with him. I'm glad I did.

Covid came; surgery was set for March, then moved to April, then moved to May. Once elective surgeries were allowed again, I told them I wanted surgery as soon as I could because the anxiety that came with the delays was getting silly and so I was the first prostatectomy allowed. The night before might have been the first time it smacked me upside the head that this was happening to me; and I had all these weird thoughts of mortality; I didn't expect that. The day of surgery, bright and early Monday, I went into registration while my wife sat in the waiting room, and it didn't occur to us that I would be going right into prep and that I wasn't seeing her after surgery. No visitors were allowed; they sent her home.

I woke up in my room post-op. Feeling a burning sensation that I had to pee. I know I kept telling the nurses that, not fully understanding that I was hooked up to a bag. I was woozy the next two days. I kind of remember seeing the surgeon right after and him telling me things were tricky because of scar tissue from the multiple biopsies and he didn't save as much of the nerve as he wanted. In my woozy state I asked what was the quickest path to recovery and he told me it was walking as much as I could handle over the next few weeks likely starting Tuesday. But within the hour I asked the nurses if we could try now; we got a walker, someone trailed me with an IV and I shuffled around the recovery ward. Each lap around the ward took around 6 minutes.

I thought I was heading home on Tuesday. Nope. The surgeon wanted me to hit a few milestones. He wanted me to stop having clots in the catheter, he wanted something different to happen in my JP drain (different color fluid? different amount of fluid? I dunno), and he wanted me to pass gas; passing gas was the big one for him. I had SO many great nurses in the hospital that kept my spirits up; and each one told me (unsolicited) how great my surgeon was; it was pretty funny.

It didn't occur to me that I was fighting myself on the passing gas issue. I was taking pain meds for my incisions whenever they offered, because I wanted to walk as much as possible. But the pain meds were slowing down my digestion, so no gas was happening. By Tuesday night I made that connection and I only had tylenol from that point on. I was drinking as much apple juice as they'd give me and on Tuesday and Wednesday I was doing about 20 laps per day around the ward. The most painful thing I dealt with was passing clots where some blood would force its way out of the catheter entry point; holy smokes that sucked; it scared me each time it happened. Finally late Wednesday my gut started rumbling and I almost didn't make it onto the throne. Sounds like whale mating calls were rumbling in my gut and we finally had movement. Whew.

So Thursday AM at shift change we started the process to leave. They took out the JP drain; it felt weird but no pain. They gave me a care package of maintenance items to care for my bags. I changed out of my gown and I was off.

As others have said, catheters are weird. You have to get your mind right about them. You have to follow instructions. I almost screwed up right away; I'm an idiot. I laid down for a few minutes in my own bed with the leg bag on and woke up over an hour later with the bag ready to burst; that sucked and scared me a lot. Also, some folks here suggested cutting slits in your undies and PJ bottoms to accommodate your catheter; great suggestions! I also got one of those grabber things to pick stuff off the floor because sometimes the catheter pinched when bending too much.

Over the next week, I was getting a bit depressed; you have to watch that. I felt like I wasn't progressing. I was walking circles a lot in my basement; I'm not sure if that was causing blood in my bag. But every night I'd see so much blood and tissue in my bag it was freaking me out. Some peices of tissue didn't look like they could have fit down the tube. And any time I sat to try to poop (no pushing), I'd feel pressure in my catheter and blood would painfully squeeze out the top; the cycle bugged me so much I cut my food intake way down so I didn't have to poop much, but all of this was making me really unhappy. The toughest days for me were about days 5 thru 9 after surgery.

On Thursday, 10 days after surgery, I got a bladder scan to make sure there were no leaks; I passed, then on Friday I got the staples out and the catheter out; it burned a bit, but it was not a big deal. I bought a bunch of pads and diapers and was ready for the next phase. To limit accidents, I woke up every hour or two to go pee. So far, I've had great bladder control; no accidents, just some leaking sometimes when I stand. After the catheter came out, there was thick blood at the start of each pee, then a stream, then some blood at the end. It was like that EVERY pee for many days and I thought I'd need some other procedure, but in the past few days there's just a couple drops of blood, sometimes not always, at the start. I'm thankful for each of these little victories.

I've read a lot about other folk's post-op issues with constipation. I've dealt with that a bit in past years. For years, I'd start the day with a Fiber One bar and lots of water and that was enough. Post-surgery, my wife makes sure I have a helping of dried apricots every day; she slices them up like gummy worms :D. I didn't expect to get any results from them, but I'm now a believer. I'm not taking any medicine to help, I've just added these with a large glass of water and I go every day; and it's never an emergency. Give it a try.

I'm just about 3 weeks since surgery and now I'm going to the park every morning. I walk 3 miles at the park and then I walk about 3 miles around the house and basement the rest of the day. I've got a lot of energy and I’m waiting for the go-ahead when I can go for a hike.

Sleep isn't great yet, but it's not bad. I'd love to sleep on my side, but my insides are still healing and sore.

I've got my first post-op blood test in 2 weeks. I'll accept any good thoughts and prayers you want to send my way.

(TMI alert) The surgeon wanted to wait until after my upcoming blood test to talk about ED and go into more detail about how much nerve was spared but he set an early expectation that nothing would happen for me a long while without shots or meds. Curiosity got the best of me and I thought ""challenge accepted"", so I felt around while in the shower today and got a good response, not 100% but I'd say 75% which surprised me; blood was moving around inside - anyway, so I finished the deed and was more than satisfied for a first experience; I'm very interested to talk to my surgeon about this.

135,My Story so far,8,f1l285,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/f1l285/my_story_so_far/,10,"Hello, my name is Mooncalled.  I'm 51 years old and I have Prostate Cancer.

I was diagnosed in August of 2019 with stage IV that metastasized to my bones.  My PSA peaked at 318. My biopsy came in hot at Gleaseon 9s and 10s.

When I was 49 my DRE was good.  Nothing to worry about.  I procrastinated on the labs my doctor ordered at the time and I know that a PSA wasn't a part of the labs.

When I turned 50 I checked in with my GP  in November of 2018 and we talked about the right of passage known as the colonoscopy and he suggested I wait until the start of the new year because it was easier to push it through the insurance company.  It was a rough start to the 2019 year.  We lost a dear family member and it was hard on us.  Colonoscopy was pushed to the back burner.  In March I developed a nagging pain in my right hip.  It would come and go, but it was starting to get painful enough to where I developed a limp to compensate.  I went back to my GP to discuss, he setup an xray and that came back with nothing.  A couple weeks later I go back and let him that this isn't getting any better.  He sets me up with a bone guy.  This is sometime in mid April.  He does another xray and notices an odd spot on my hip bone and chalks it up to arthritis based on my running experience.  Sends me off to PT for a month.  I go back after 6 weeks and tell him it's gotten no better, PT helped but I'm still limping like a peg-legged pirate in a heavy storm.  He orders up an MRI.  I don't hear anything for a week.  I got back to the bone guy and he's asking if I heard from my GP.  Nope, not a word.  He drops an F-bomb and says he'll be right back.  He comes back 20 minutes later and he's still red in the face from anger/embarrassment.  ""I called your GP and laid into him.  this is crazy and I'm sorry.""  He proceeds to show me the MRI and points out some areas as possible cancer.  ""Look, I'm not an oncologist so, I'm not an expert by any means in this area, but get to your GP.  He's waiting for you.""

My GP orders up a PSA and some other tests and codes it under weight loss.  I had lost 10 pounds in a matter of a week without a change in my diet.  I gave him the fish eye and he kind of shrugs and tells me it's easier to sell it to the insurance company that way, plus we get a quicker response from the labs.  He calls me later that day to tell me the bad news.  PSA is 251.  This is early June.  He orders up a bunch of more tests, CT scan, MRI.  He's making sure it didn't spread to my lymph nodes.  Those test come back with slight irregularities but nothing to call the fire department for.  He ships me off to a urologist he know.

I do the biopsy with him and it comes in worse than expected.  We talk about hormone suppression and he's already got it approved with the insurance company and we can start today...

I asked him about the pain in my leg and he just kind of shrugs and says it might be related.  If you want we can set you up with  radiologist and get it zapped.  I give him the hold up hands and tell him I'll get back to him.  I get he's trying to make it sound routine but he failed miserably.  This was in August.

When my PSA came in June, my wife had called and talked to CTCA.  I wanted to stick with the urologist.  When I first met him before the biopsy, he seemed like an upfront guy.  After the biopsy not so much.  He's demeanor was off putting.  I ended the two visits I had with him with this question ""Is there any question I'm not asking?""  Both times I got crickets.  It's a question doctors don't expect I think.

So, in less than 18 months I developed an aggressive form of prostate cancer and both doctors that I was seeing never mentioned I should consult with an oncologist.  This is something I can't stress enough of.  Advocate with your GP or urologist that you want to see an oncologist as soon as you hear the cancer word.

I'm gonna shorten up here a bit.  Since late August I've been treated at CTCA in Goodyear, AZ.  As soon as me and my wife walked into the facility we knew this was the right place.  They fly me out for my treatments at no charge to me.  On the first consult they flew me and my wife at no charge.  We live in California.

My bone scans did come back very dark.  Mostly on my right side.  PSA was 318 in late August and Alkaline Phospates came in greater than 6k.

I'm on round 4 of 6 of Chemo.  I am on hormone suppression (lubron).  I have had 3 weeks of radiation therapy on my  hotspots in my bones.  I still have my prostate.  My PSA is 1.96.  I've had a femural rod inserted into my right leg.  It hasn't been easy but in a way it feels that way.  I've been fortunate to have minimal side effects from Chemo.  I'm on the right side of all the numbers still.

God bless and peace be with you.",2020-02-10 04:28:54+00:00,"['Wow, that’s quite the story. I’m really sorry you had to go through all of that. Really sorry.

140,Second Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer-- SEEKING ADVICE AND CONVERSATION,7,dn16fv,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/dn16fv/second_biochemical_recurrence_of_prostate_cancer/,9,"Hi everyone,

My Dad has just been diagnosed with his second biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. He was originally diagnosed with PC in 2011 at the age of 57 and he had a radical prostatectomy. His PSA began to creep back up in 2016 and he was treated with salvage radiation (I’m unsure of how many treatments) and one hormone shot (I’m unsure of which one). The salvage therapy brought his PSA back down to 0.062 and we were good to go.

His PSA began to creep up again in April of this year, but I’m not sure what the number was then. He chose to keep a watchful eye on it, but by October of this year, his PSA had dramatically shot up to 20. They tested it twice to make sure it wasn’t a false reading and, a week after, it was at 22. CT and PET scans showed that he has two enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, which is probably cancer, but it is thankfully not in his bones.

I am extremely unhappy with his current urologist as they are making us wait FIVE WEEKS for an appointment and they would not tell him anything regarding his prognosis, whether he could ever potentially go into remission again or if the cancer was aggressive (which we all assume it is due to his PSA count and the PSA velocity). I’ve made him an appointment at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville for a second opinion, a couple weeks after his first appointment with his current urologist.

Dad is my favorite person in the entire world and I am NOT ready for him to go yet. I’m posting because I want to aggressively fight this and I’m seeking advice, guidance, links to resources you like and/or stories from those who have been in similar situations as my Dad’s. I know we won’t get all the answers until we hear more from the docs, but I’m going out of my mind with worry since they decided to leave us totally in the dark, so researching and posting about it makes me feel useful. Here are some things on my mind that I’d love to start a discussion about:  


* Has anyone ever had/know of someone who has had a salvage lymph node dissection/removal after radical prostatectomy and what was the outcome?
* If removing the lymph nodes is possible (and I’ve found several studies that say it is and that it’s potentially beneficial), does Dad’s PSA of 20 make him ineligible for such a surgery?
* With a PSA of 20, but only two enlarged lymph nodes, does that mean there’s lots of cancer floating around elsewhere in his body and we just can’t see it yet?
* Does his high PSA velocity and PSA doubling time mean that it’s super aggressive?
* Has anyone else had a similar journey as Dad? How long have you been living with advanced PC? What is your quality of life like?
* Any patients or caretakers in similar situations who wish they had opted for a different kind of treatment or path than what they did?
* I want him to have the cancer genetically tested so that it can be treated individually and not with standard of care—anyone done this?
* Particular website or blog you keep up with?
* Give me ANY and ALL advice you have—I’m not interested in sugar coating. I want to know the truth so that I know what next best steps to take.
* Any websites or blogs that you keep up with that post about the latest in PC research and treatments?

Do you know your father's Gleason score?  This would have been something they told him when he was first diagnosed.  That might give you a good idea of how aggressive the cancer is.  PSA doubling time can also be an indicator of aggressiveness.  To find that out you'd want to get his number from April.  \n\n2. I am almost certain they can remove the lymph nodes; I'm not sure why his PSA level would disqualify him from surgery.  \n\n3.  PSA can go into the thousands, so while 20 is a high number, it is not nearly as high as it can get.  That might mean that he is less likely to have other metastases.\n\n4. I know of men who have lived a very long time with metastasized prostate cancer.  If your father's cancer is localized to the lymph nodes, that is a very good thing.  But even if there are distant metastases, the cancer can often be managed for many years.  I'm not saying that will happen in your father's case, but right now there's no reason to think it won't, either.\n\n\nWebsites: PCF.org\ncancer.gov\n\nSeveral hospital websites are helpful: [Memorial Sloan Kettering] (https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/types/prostate) is especially good. Their [nomograms] (https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate) page can give you very good estimates of risk and outcomes for various treatments and various stages of the disease, if you have the right numbers.

Thanks for your advice.",2019-04-10 01:21:57+00:00,"[""I had this surgery 18 months ago.  Here are some things he might not even know he will want or need until after the surgery.  I hope it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, he may have a lot of gas pain for a couple of days.  This is because they pump gas in to expand the abdomen during surgery.  It then has to make its way into the rectum and out.  This was by far the most painful and unpleasant part of the experience.  The best thing he can do is get up and walk.  He will need to move his body to get his bowel motility going again.  A heating pad also helps.  And if he's on any kind of opioid, make sure he takes stool softeners, too.  He likely won't have a bowel movement for a few days, but the last thing he'll want is to be constipated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning to deal with the catheter is another issue he may not anticipate.  It is difficult and frankly humiliating learning to change the bag.  Not sure there's much you can do to help other than be as understanding and compassionate as possible. There will likely be two different kinds of bags they will give him--a small one to strap onto his leg so he can go out, and a larger one he will have to carry around with him at home.  He should have a place he can hang this bag very near him (the tube is only about three feet long) when he is lying down or sitting.  I used an open drawer from my bedside table.  Another thing I found was invaluable was having a bathrobe.  Changing clothes is difficult with the bag, so I spent most of the first two weeks in mine.  He probably has one, but if not, buy him one.  He will also need adult diapers for when the catheter is removed.  Make sure he has them beforehand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe may not be comfortable lying down at all for several days or more.  For the first week or so I spent most of my time in a recliner.  So if he doesn't have a recliner, make sure there are plenty of pillows for him to prop himself up in bed.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was not hungry for three or four days after surgery, and he likely won't be as long as he has gas pain and until his bowels start moving again.  I was able to have some soup, ice cream, pudding, things like that.  Friends and family brought food, but I ended up not eating much.  So you might not worry about making sure he has meals for the first day or two.  If you are going to make food, you'll probably want to keep it simple--soup, stew, stuff like that.  The only solid food I had any appetite for was plain buttered toast.  And popsicles.   I ate a lot of those.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you have the perfect attitude going in--be there to help, but give him the space he needs to maintain his dignity.  The whole process from diagnosis through surgery through after-care can be pretty dehumanizing and demoralizing.  Nothing has ever made me feel quite so old and weak as that surgery.  He may be dealing with permanent side effects which he may not feel comfortable talking about.  I'm not sure how you might go about checking in with him about that.  Depending on what they find and how serious his cancer is, he may also be dealing with the anxiety of that long after the surgery.  I know I was a wreck until after my first PSA test came back clear.  I'm better now, but I still start getting anxious when it's time to get another test.  So try to remember that he may seem a lot better in a couple of weeks, but from his perspective the experience itself may continue long after.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, these are just my thoughts having gone through it.

I have posted on this topic before but it is really beginning to get me down.

I'm just under 70, was diagnosed about two years ago with PC, and ultimately chose to have the prostatectomy by RALP.

The good news is that this appears to have beaten the cancer : all PSA tests since then show undetectable PSA.  So of course I am thankful for that.

The bad news at first was that I had really severe incontinence.  But luckily, with patience and a lot of kegels, it began tapering off at about nine months post-RALP and I am now good for a single adult diaper over 24 hours or so.

But the lingering bad news is that I seem to have lost any sexual sensitivity in my penis.  I am not referring only to erectile dysfunction : I would probably live with that.  But I have no ability whatsoever to have an orgasm or even to be ""turned on"" down there.  Masturbation does nothing for me, watching my favorite erotica does nothing for me, there is really no sexual feeling at all.

I have just learned that my dad (72yo) found out he has prostate and it has metastasized to his lungs. He has started taking Eligard injections. 

I am worried since my parents are not good at communicating about his illness to me (they have translators speaking to him through phone at the hospital, my sister went together with him).

157,"Assessment of pelvic-floor strength before radical prostatectomy may allow for more accurate prediction of early return of continence after surgery, new research indicates.",7,nttmla,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/nttmla/assessment_of_pelvicfloor_strength_before_radical/,6,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Assessment of pelvic-floor strength before radical prostatectomy may allow for more accurate prediction of early return of continence after surgery, new research indicates.

Urinary incontinence is a common short-term complication of radical prostatectomy (RP). While continence is eventually achieved in most patients, predicting when patients will become continent is challenging. Prior studies aiming to predict return of continence after the surgery have not evaluated patient-specific parameters of pelvic-floor strength, the study team explains in a paper in Urology.

Dr. Peter Chang with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and colleagues studied 144 men who underwent RP and underwent assessment of pelvic-floor strength by a trained physical therapist prior to surgery. As part of the assessment, the men were given a home exercise program to improve their pelvic-floor-muscle strength. All of the men completed three-month patient-reported quality of life evaluation.

Three months after RP, 90 of the men (62.5%) were continent (defined as using zero or one pad per day). On multivariate analysis, preoperative pelvic-floor endurance was significantly associated with being continent at three months (odds ratio, 2.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 6.17).

Nearly three-quarters of men (74%) with good pelvic-floor endurance were continent, compared with 50% of men with poor endurance.

Higher prostate volume was associated with slightly lower rates of continence at three months on multivariable analysis (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00; P=0.036).

""To our knowledge this is the first study to assess the link between objective preoperative measures of pelvic floor muscle strength and timing of continence after RP,"" Dr. Chang and colleagues say.

""Our study suggests that preoperative assessment by a trained pelvic floor physical therapist (PFPT) with electromyography (EMG) pelvic floor muscle measurements can aid in patient counseling regarding timing of return of continence after RP,"" they write.

""EMG pelvic floor muscle measurements are easily obtained during a preoperative physical therapy visit and can be used in conjunction with biofeedback for preoperative assessment. When counseling a patient prior to RP it is critical to discuss the known risks of incontinence and erectile dysfunction,"" they say.

""Using PFPT assessment to augment education and improve the accuracy of preoperative counseling is likely to improve quality of life and decrease the potential for decision regret for a patient choosing among potential treatments for prostate cancer,"" they conclude.",2021-06-06 19:35:15+00:00,"['I was given training prior to my operation and I left the hospital without pads and had no issues.

I have just recently been diagnosed with High volume, high risk PC. 67 yo, pretty active and healthy otherwise. 7 out of 12 biopsies are positive with Gleason scores of 4+3 and 3+4, PSA of 22. Bone Scan and MRI did not detect metastasis to bone, lymph or seminal glands. I have been advised to start with  ADT, probably Degarelix instead of Lupron due to past CardoVascular issues.

I am trying to decide radiation vs surgery (Likely surgery+radiation). Surgeon thinks too much involvement and unlikely to save nerve. Radiation will likely have the same effect over the next few years. It seems like one is 6 and the other a half dozen. The effect of radiation on other parts seem to be a wild card. I have read that the overall success between the two are the same and highly successful.

Wednesday I was grocery shopping with my wife. \n\nFeel free to send me a chat if you have more questions.', 'Sorry to hear about your diagnosis, it’s no fun.  I just had a robot-assist prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy last Wednesday.  I’m 54 with Gleason 3+4.  My PSA at diagnosis was 9.57, and 7 weeks later just prior to surgery it had risen to 11.17.  My lymph nodes were negative but the post-surgery pathology report found quite a bit of microscopic bladder neck invasion.  It sounds like I will likely need to have ADT and radiation therapy to mop up the remaining cancer, unfortunately.  I was otherwise very happy with my surgery and am recovering much better than I expected.  Walked two miles the second day after surgery, four miles the third day, and did a bit over four miles again on day 5.   Very little pain from the surgery, although my abdominal area was pretty achy.  Surprisingly the worst pain from the whole thing came from my shoulder/neck area on the evening of the day after surgery.  I think that was caused by the gas they pumped into my abdominal area to give the surgeon room to work.  I spent a lot of time researching my local surgeon to get to the point where I felt I could fully trust him.  \n\nUpsides of surgery:\n- Allows the surgeon to really see what’s going on in there, and provides a full pathology report after surgery.  If I had done radiation I don’t think they would have known about the microscopic bladder neck invasion, although perhaps the radiation would have ended up treating the bladder neck anyway.  On the other hand, maybe the radiation folks would have tried to avoid the bladder neck out of caution (assuming they can even do that).  I don’t know what the outcome of radiation would have been, but I’m glad I know about the microscopic bladder neck invasion.  Imaging isn’t perfect and cancer is sneaky.\n- if surgery doesn’t get all the cancer, then you have the option to do salvage radiation afterward.  That radiation treatment won’t be negatively impacted following surgery.  On the other hand if you do radiation first, a salvage prostatectomy is a very difficult procedure for a surgeon to perform.  My surgeon said radiation treatment before surgery makes the prostate “sticky” and difficult to work with.\n- Assuming you don’t need radiation after surgery, then you have a pretty good idea within a few months of what your new life looks like.  If instead you choose radiation you might have an easier time with side effects in the short term but then years down the line might begin to experience more pronounced radiation side effects.  Hopefully they’d be mild, as opposed to something like a secondary cancer.  But you have to wait and wonder a long time to find out for sure.\n\nDownsides of surgery:\n- In my mind you really have to put in a lot of research to get comfortable enough to choose your surgeon and hospital.  And it can be very difficult to find reliable sources of information about surgeons and hospitals.  Maybe I’m wrong but successful radiation therapy seems less sensitive to the choice of practitioner.  I’ve never heard of anyone going out of their way to find a “superstar” radiation oncologist, but I’ve seen plenty of stories about people who have sought out preeminent surgeons.\n- Some hospitals have residents perform significant portions of the surgery, and then the surgeon you actually spoke to and selected for your surgery comes in later to to do the harder stuff.  My surgeon suggested that approach, saying the resident would act as a sort of “driver trainee” under the surgeon’s close supervision and would basically clear a path to the prostate.  Once the resident reached the prostate my surgeon would take over.  I told my surgeon I preferred to have him personally do as much of my surgery as possible.  If the resident’s contributions improved the likelihood of a positive surgical outcome, that was great.  But if the education of the resident detracted from my surgical outcome I was not comfortable with that.  \n-  Surgery isn’t fun nor is it convenient.  You have to take time off from work, and you have to wear a catheter for a week or two.  In general the better your physical condition going in, the easier your recovery will be.  If you don’t exercise and are significantly overweight or obese, recovery from surgery might be rough.  I’d been exercising about 10-12 hours/week for the year prior to surgery.  I’m only about 8 pounds over weight.  It was still surprisingly difficult/painful for me to try to get out of bed for the first time at the hospital given the soreness in my abdominal area.  If I’d been 30 pounds overweight with weak abs I doubt I could have rolled out of bed on my own and the attempt would have been most unpleasant.\n\nI hope this info helps you a bit with your decision making.  For what it’s worth I found the books “The Key to Prostate Cancer” by Mark Scholz and “Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer” by Johns Hopkins surgeon Patrick Walsh to be very helpful in my decision making.  I also read “Man to Man: Surviving Prostate Cancer”, which is a very sobering account of one man’s open (non-robotic) prostatectomy as performed by the aforementioned surgeon Patrick Walsh in the mid-1990s.  The recovery process described in that book was much more severe than what I experienced, and I suspect it’s much more severe than the recoveries of most robotic-assist patients.  It does have some valuable info, but don’t let its Steven King vibe scare you away from today’s surgical methods.\n\nBest of luck to you, I really hope you beat this thing.', 'I’m 48, but had a similar situation 8/12 biopsies came back 3+4, 1/12 3+3, PSA of 45.

He's 65 and recently diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. He's doing okay in the sense that he's had no symptoms from the cancer or side effects from the ADT. Other than the cancer, he's in relatively good health and active for his age. The ADT took his PSA from 19 down to 6 over the past month, and the next step will be 6 infusions of docetaxel every 3 weeks.

I would note though that even during the more severe crashes, the symptoms ebbed and flowed.

Active Surveillance - Repeat PSA testing and biopsies. For patients with low grade, low volume disease. The rational here is that you’re far more likely to die from something else before the cancer harms you.\n\n2. Radical Prostatectomy - Surgical removal of the prostate. Usually requires a 1-2 day stay in the hospital. Side effects commonly include incontinence and impotence. Many patients do not regain function. The side effect profile is immediate with surgery, recovery, if it occurs, happens over the course of months to years. In case of recurrence, salvage radiation is an option.   \n\n3. Radiotherapy - There are more options with radiation. Standard treatment usually includes concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. Side effects of ADT are hot flashes, muscle loss, loss of libedo. Side effects from radiation are more commonly bowel than incontinence, but also includes impotence. The onset of the side-effect profile is delayed with radiation, whereas it is immediate with surgery. In cause of recurrence, surgery is generally not possible.\n\nIf radical treatment is required choosing between surgery and radiation is the main decision you’ll have to make. In terms of effectiveness they are both highly effective if the cancer is contained within the prostate and has no metastasized to other areas of the body.\n\nIf the cancer has spread ADT is the only option moving forward. This slows the growth of the cancer by starving it of testosterone. Eventually the cancer becomes resistant to this treatment though.\n\nThere are some cases where alternative treatments may be a good option depending on his diagnosis. High frequency ultrasound, laser thermal therapy, proton beam therapy, brachytherapy, etc. These types of treatments focus on reducing the side-effect profile while still providing adequate cancer control.', ""I hope you get better news, and you almost certai ly will.

Dr said the prostate exam feels normal. Dr did another blood test 3 days later to see if it was just a spike but the result is 9.54.

If you are in your late 60s and are diagnosed with Gleason 6 then it really is no big deal. But what the general public doesn\'t seem to understand is that there are different grades of prostate cancer. Most prostate cancers are diagnosed when you\'re much older, and will grow so slowly you\'ll be much more likely to die with prostate cancer rather than from it. Other forms are aggressive and should be taken very seriously. Gleason 8 is no joke for a 53 year old man. You shouldn\'t freak out, but you also shouldn\'t feel embarrassed for taking it very seriously because it is very serious. \n\nDo your research. Speak to a surgical and a radiological oncologist. Get second opinions. None of them will tell you this is no big deal, but they might have different ideas about how best to treat it. That\'s a decision you have to make, and it will be one of the most difficult decisions you ever make. If people around you don\'t understand that then as you learn more you might want to educate them. Or you can keep it to yourself and let them think whatever they want. But you have to know you have a serious disease and you need to attack it head-on, without embarrassment or shame and without second-guessing yourself.', 'Don’t feel embarrassed or stupid.  Also, get a second opinion.\n\nI’m 59 and am alive today because my Primary Care Physician (PCP) insisted back in the spring of 2017 that I get checked, then biopsied (mid-November 2017), then have surgery (mid-March 2018), for something that was consistently downplayed as not being a big deal.\n\nYes, my PSA was low — the highest it ever reached was 5.4 — and I didn’t have any of the classic signs of prostate cancer, other than having to urinate more frequently than in the past.  However, my PCP performed a DRE and discovered that my prostate was at least 50% larger than it should be, and it didn’t feel right during the exam in his opinion.\n\nThe 12-core biopsy results came back with three of them being positive, with a Gleason score of 6 on all three.  The general consensus from both the urologist and my PCP was that this should be considered somewhere between a “slow” and “aggressive” form of prostate cancer, and that I should have it removed within a 12-month period.  No long-term monitoring, just get it done.\n\nAgain, through all of this, I continually had trained medical staff telling me that it was waaaaay too early for me to have surgery, my numbers were too low, I wasn’t presenting any of the classic symptoms, etc.  Some of them didn’t take it seriously at all.\n\nI got second opinions on everything, got lined up with a medical oncologist who coordinated everything, and he hooked me up with one of the best prostate surgeons in our region.  Finally had the surgery done in late March 2018.\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know it...  The forensic pathology came back positive for the cancer having breached the walls of the prostate gland.  It was only at this point that so many of the medical naysayers swallowed their earlier words and said that it was a good thing I listened to my PCP and proceeded with the aggressive treatment.\n\nAfter all that, I went through seven-and-a-half weeks of radiation treatment, finally finishing that up in mid-July of 2018.  With each PSA test since then, my numbers have been consistently at <0.1 (undetectable) — so my medical team is cautiously optimistic that the cancer is in full remission, and that we finally got all of it.\n\nA friend of mine — of the same age — was not so lucky.  His PSA numbers never went above 2.0, yet when they finally diagnosed him, it was for Stage IV prostate cancer.  Scans revealed that it had spread throughout his entire body, and he went through chemo, surgery, radiation, hormone, immunotherapy, a second round of surgery, clinical trial chemo, and was part-way through a second round of traditional chemo when he finally died last summer.\n\nTake this very seriously, until you have PSA numbers that indicate it is in remission, and take it seriously even then.', ""To the OP: your rising PSA level is a cause for concern. Gleason 4+4 indicates an aggressive cancer. Provided that it's caught while confined to the prostate, the outcomes for patients are extremely good. My tumour had broken through the prostate capsule (wall), but the pathology report said there was no evidence the cancer has spread.\n\nI don't wish to frighten you, but don't be lulled into a sense of false security by other people's often unfounded opinions.\n\nThe best bits of advice I can give you is to always listen to the tiny voice inside your head. Also, seek out a hospital with an excellent reputation and a surgeon who performs hundreds of operations a year.\n\n I find the following site very useful:\n\nhttps://prostatecanceruk.org/"", '1) be concerned with your health 2) get to a reputable urologist without delay 3) your numbers are high.', 'I was diagnosed at 49 and am currently 53. The issue you face is that you are very young at the onset of the disease. Every urologist I’ve seen has said how young I was to have this disease. It sounds like you have several possible curative steps available - surgery and radiation. In my case neither was successful. While prostate cancer can be managed as an almost chronic disease through other routes like hormone therapy, even these therapies will eventually fail.

Don’t delay consultation, make your wisest and best supported decisions with the medical team. Ignore public ‘opinions’ - most people have a cognitive bias on PCa, unsure why.  PCa treatment is very developed and let’s hope they get yours clean and it ends here!  :)\n\nI had the surgery, which was actually amazing from a minimal physical impact perspective. Unfortunately, I also had a positive contact margin. Just finished salvage radiation therapy, and hope we got this sucker.

Began hormone treatment immediately (it sucks, but it works), then had surgery (sadly he couldn't do nerve-sparing due to the aggressive nature of the damn cancer) one of the removed lymph nodes came back positive for cancer, so then had to undergo 32 days of radiation (bit of fatigue, but still able to go to work.) I finished the hormone treatment after 1 year. My PSA is 0, but so is my testosterone. We are waiting for my testosterone to climb back naturally, and hopefully if my PSA remains at 0, then I'm out of the woods.\n\nIt is definitely scary - don't beat yourself up about that.

181,Sigh - So I've joined the club...and have a question or two.,7,ep7mdt,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/ep7mdt/sigh_so_ive_joined_the_cluband_have_a_question_or/,37,"So, after almost six months of tests (bloodwork, ultrasound, IRM, biopsy...) the verdict has finally fallen, and here I  am, a full member of the club, Gleason 3+3 / 3+3 / 3+4.  Urologist thinks a prostatectomy is the likely treatment but wants a PET done first to make sure that it hasn't spread anywhere else (in which case hormone and radiation therapy).  

I'm not surprised, although a bit angry as I literally have just retired and was hoping to enjoy at least a bit of my retirement before the inevitable health problems associated with getting older set in.  I'm also confused as to why it took six months to diagnose fully, but hey ho.

Any words of advice, wisdom, or just plain empathy warmly appreciated.  More particularly, if anyone has any experience with PET scans, I'd appreciate hearing -- I know it is important to determine whether the cancer is limited to the prostate itself or has spread to surrounding areas, but I don't understand why they need to do yet another test to tell (i.e. why this didn't show up after all the other tests.

Thanks in advance!",2020-01-15 20:10:09+00:00,"['As someone who\'s been there, I feel your pain. Literally.  On the positive side, Gleason 7 (3+4) is designated ""intermediate risk"" so, as they say, things could be worse. \n\nThe PET scan will probably use choline, because prostate cancer loves choline.  That test is designed to look for even very small metastases distant from the prostate. None of the other tests they do (as far as I know) can do that--they just tell you whether you have prostate cancer and what grade it is. Some imaging might be able to detect cancer outside but near the prostate, like in the nearby lymph nodes, but treatment for someone with distant metastases is going to be different that treatment for cancer that remains near the prostate. As you point out, your oncologist is unlikely to recommend prostatectomy if there are distant metastases, but may if it has only spread to the surrounding area (in which case the surgeon would likely remove all that cancerous tissue). Sometimes cancer is only found in the lymph nodes when they do the prostatectomy, so doing a PET scan first seems like a good idea even if the cancer is localized--that way they will have a better idea of what\'s going on and what needs to be removed before they go in. If it has spread locally, after surgery they would probably do radiation to try to kill any remaining cancer in the area--then you wait and get your PSA tested forever to see if anything shows up. \n\nOn a positive note, assuming the cancer is no more aggressive than 3+4, I think (I am not a doctor, just some guy who did a lot of research when he was diagnosed) the likelihood of distant mets is pretty small. \n\nAs for advice, it\'s the same I give every man who asks: 1) get a second opinion, if you can. And a third, if possible. There are a lot of treatment options (including no treatment) and there are always a lot of unknowns (for instance, they cannot definitively say what your Gleason score is until *after* they remove your prostate--which isn\'t very helpful in deciding *whether* to have a prostatectomy), so it\'s good to get as many opinions as you can. \n\nI would also recommend doing as much of your own research as you can. There\'s an excellent book, recently updated, called Dr. Patrick Walsh\'s Surviving Prostate Cancer (his name is part of the title). It\'s a good way to really begin to understand what is happening and what may happen in the future (some of it is frightening and unpleasant, but better to be informed, imo). There\'s also lots of information on the web. Personally I would stick to sites run by major cancer centers (Memorial Sloan Kettering is very good) and non-profits; being the internet, there\'s also lots of bad or misleading information out there.  \n\nFinally, prostate cancer usually grows slowly, and Gleason 7 (3+4) is the second least aggressive designation.

So now he's trying to stick mostly to a fruit/veggie low-GI diet - he has cut out sugar (except for natural sugar in low-GI fruit), all snack stuff (chips, etc), and now eats very little meat. I'm glad he's watching his diet but he's lost a ton of weight, isn't sleeping well, and just in general feels really terrible (caused by a combination of physical and mental things, I know).

It honestly made me feel a lot better to see all these men with the same disease working together, helping each other and making the best of a tough situations. It’s pretty amazing. There are a few guys on there that honestly might know more than most Dr’s.  It’s very common for people to post detailed info about there disease and ask questions. It’s pretty neat. For example if you go there and post the details about his disease and his current treatment you could ask if this is the best approach or if there are other things to try and people will chime in.

I'm 63, former military, and recently retired from government service. In May I went in for my regular bloodwork for my diabetes, blood pressure, and heart (I have a stent in the circumflex). All the numbers were good ... except:

May 2021 - PSA: 5.4

June 2021 - PSA Retest: 5.7

June 2021 - Prostate Biopsy

July 2021 - Biopsy results showed two of the twelve cores were positive with Gleason scores of 4+3 = 7 (see below).

July 2021 - My doctor immediately wanted to have a CT Scan and Bone Scan with contrast to see if anything had spread outside of the prostate.

July 2021 - CT Scan and Bone Scan completed.

Aug 2021 - Meeting with doctor to discuss results. Both the CT and Bone scans were negative and showed zero spread. But because of the 4+3=7 Gleason he took active monitoring off the table and is letting me decide between surgery or radiation oncology.

Aug 2021 - The day after the the consultation with my urologist, the oncology clinic referral he sent out called me with my choice of appointment times. I am scheduled to see them on 8/24 to review my biopsies, scans, records, etc. and available options. The earliest I can schedule surgery (if I go that route) is in October.

During this entire period my wife has been my rock ... she found this sub and kept telling me about some of the posts. Some of the time I tend to block this all out of my head, other times I heavily ponder the various options and implications, especially after reading all of the possibilities. Initially I was leaning toward surgery ... but the more I think about my current medical situation and fitness level ... I am liking the seeds option more and more. But I'll wait until after the oncology consult and think on it some more.

Thanks for listening.

As the title says, my dad was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 and a PSA just above 5. Last year in August, it 5.05, and in June it came back as 5.03. So it pretty much remained stable.

After getting these results, the doctor wanted to order additional tests to make sure the cancer has not spread (he ordered a pelvic CT and a complete bone scan). He also suggested my dad take a genome test to see how aggressive his cancer might be.

His cores that were positive were 2% and 10%.

Does this suggest that the cancer is in an early and highly treatable stage? My dad is generally in excellent health, so I was shocked by his diagnosis. The only thing I can think of that might impact his health is his smoking.

I've heard CT scans might not be worth it for a Gleason Score of 6, however the doctor suggested it and we figured it would be better since Gleason scores varies per doctor who analyzes the biopsy results.

I'd appreciate any feedback and advice.",2021-07-08 22:30:08+00:00,"[""Highly treatable, almost rookie numbers but PC ain't no joke so gotta deal with it before it spreads as if it spreads it's much harder to deal with.

Gleason 6 is not even considered cancer by many urologists but that doesn\'t mean that the biopsy caught everything. 2% and 10% positive cores is a very low and encouraging stat.

One thing to take into consideration here is that Gleason 6 prostate cancer is the lowest grade prostate cancer that currently exists. You should not think of this cancer as a 6 out of 10, because the Gleason score is a bit outdated. Rather his diagnosis at this point would be closer to a 1 out of 5. \n\nSome potential problems that could exist is the fact that the trans rectal biopsy misses about 30% of clinically significant cancers. So although he is a Gleason 6 there is a possibility that other cancers could be hiding.\n\nI would be curious to see what his MRI showed if anything.

Took out the prostate, lymph nodes, etc. also repaired a hernia we found while doing the imaging. 

The UTSW staff was wonderful. The doctors all communicated well. Dr Bagrodia is an amazing human and skilled surgeon. He told my wife the nerve sparing was good and he predicted that part would be successful. 

The nurses and pain folks were very kind and attentive. I was able to checkout the next afternoon and slept in my own bed. Came home pretty bloated as I’d been told. Not just remaining gas. I weighed 11 pounds more than the morning before. 

Catheter came out on day five after surgery. Decent control during the procedure. Stopped stool softeners and prescription pain meds too. Dr. Goldberg is my Urologist and has been great. 

Pathology report came back yesterday (day 6) and seems good. Have only had a chance to exchange brief notes with the UTSW team but I’m grateful they didn’t sit on it. And the communication was encouraging. 

Took what I expect is my last prescription drugs yesterday - antibiotics to support the catheter removal. Felt good enough to make a brief appearance at the office. I still need to go slow and nap during the day. 

Last night I got up to pee twice, but no leaks or accidents. 

Today is my first day on OTC pain support only. 

Early next week I hope to have my surgical drainage bags removed. Today most of thee drainage seems to be stopping and I’ll get a better debrief from Dr Goldberg on the pathology results. 

I’m still some bloated. Not all the fluids and weight are gone. Not clear to drive yet. Moved my car in the driveway and just going 30 feet was plenty. Maybe a few more days.

- found the P.C. pretty early 
- found the hidden hernia and another latent issue we’d have missed without all the other imaging 
- looks like we are a close to “got it all” as they will say these days
- pain has been minimal - I’ve been more miserable on purpose during a cold weather hunt

Blood flow and nerves determine whether your guy is in a contracted or nice and full state. I had full nerve sparing, but one “accessory artery” was removed. Claimed to be redundant to penile blood flow for erections. At 3 months, my flaccid state is currently not what it used to be, but erections seem very close to the old dimensions.

Recommendation was surgery or radiation.  Due to good health and life expectancy of 20-30 years (if cancer doesn't kill me), I choose surgery, Da Vinci RALP at JH.  

My original surgery was scheduled for April 7, but was delayed until July 9 due to Covid.  This gave me an additional 3 months of PT prior to surgery.

My wife dropped me at the front door at 9:30 for a noon surgery.  I was afraid I would have to wait around, but the time went quickly.  Stripped, gowned, and IV ported, I was interviewed by a bevy of anesthesiologists, nurses, residents and finally the surgeon.  I was the team's second prostatectomy of the day and they wheeled me into the operatory around 11:30.  I was a bit overwhelmed by all the people and instrumentation in the room.  They started hooking up sensors and started the IV, I remember my last thought was ""what a cute nurse/resident"".

I woke up with severe abdominal pain.  I vaguely remember thrashing around on the bed asking for meds and water.  I was given a few ice chips and shortly a wave of peace wash over me as the meds kicked in.  Next thing I remember was waking up in my hospital room around 5 pm.

That night was a blur, I had some water ice and meds, but I couldn't get out of bed for a walk due to the pain.

Pain was both inthe abs and right shoulder.  The day following surgery was spent slowly walking the floor and sleeping.  I was not ready to be dismissed, again due to abdominal pain, so I stayed an extra night.  I was finally dismissed around 11 the next morning.

Waiting on my urologist office to schedule a visit with Duke prostate oncology department in Durham but about to take that in my own hands as I'm not happy with the time it's taking for the referral. It appears that Dr. Moul at Duke has a lot of experience on this matter - has anyone here been treated by him?

Immersing myself in all the information I can find on typical treatment options and post-treatment life. I already have 4 kids and had a vasectomy 5 years ago so that part is ok, but potentially losing my ability to have erections and having dry orgasms are just things I never expected to have to think about. Obviously living a long life is the most important outcome, just trying to rationalize it all.

I've read some references here in other posts about things to do prior to treatment such as Kegels and I guess penile enlargement exercises as I've read about penile shortening. Not even sure where to start to look to find actual information on how to start any of these routines.

I'm sure there are more important things to worry about. I'm wondering if Duke will want to do their own biopsy so soon after the last one (which I'm still ejaculating blood from after 4 climaxes) -- or if they have other methods such as MRI etc that can be used. Lots of questions I suspect won't be answered until I get in to see them.

I am currently in a relationship with a man older  than me recently and it is going well with him.  He explained to me that  he had prostate cancer 5 years ago and he had his prostate removed.  He  showed me all the little scars on his stomach and told me that he is  fully healed but cannot have children after this surgery.

When  we last met, things went further and I started to masturbate him, he  has a good erection and seemed to be enjoying himself but after a while  there was some discomfort between us and he did not seem to want that I  continue and I did not insist.

I  really don't know much about the prostate and the male reproductive  system and I started to read a little bit about it.

During the few seconds before ejaculation there is the emission phase where all its glands contract and expel their liquids in the urethra at the level of the prostate, a strong tension is felt, the semen is then created and ready to be expelled.

Right. So after months of tests, ultrasounds, scans and whatnot, it is now clear that I will be having a prostatectomy very soon. 

My wife has been very supportive throughout...and I want to be supportive to her in turn.  I know from various threads here on Reddit, from medical publications etc, that there is a good chance I will not be able to sustain an erection for some time post-op and I am comfortable with that - getting the cancer out is the key. But I am hoping I can be intimate with her - and satisfy her - in other ways during that time. 

She has never been much for toys, vibrators, etc during our 40 years of marriage - strictly a « meat and two veg » woman.  Even finger and tongue play is not very much her style other than for foreplay, but really satisfying her has always required good old PIV sex (at least that is what she tells me).

So...(clears throat again), I would like - if she consents - to include some toys into our intimacy while the little fella is getting back up to speed. As both she and I are not exactly familiar with « the latest technology », can any of you recommend what the Rolls Royce of vibrators/similar toys is these days?

My father is a 70 year old retired army officer; he keeps himself very fit and active (he's still got his triceps, even), save for a slight piling on the pounds that happened when he chose to cancel his gym membership due to COVID (hoping to re-enable later this week). 

Earlier this week he was referred to the Oncology department where the Doctor told him he has minor, localised prostate cancer (so Stage 1 I guess). I don't know what his Gleason score is exactly, but the Doctor said 'there are cancers which are tigers and there are cancers which are cats, you've got a cat.' They also said the cancer tumour was very small (I wasn't with him when he went to the Oncologist, I'm reporting back what he told me).

So, they've told him they wont treat it right now, but will be watching it. So they've scheduled him to come in February of next year, which will be 6 months from now.

He had an inkling that he would have Prostate Cancer, but was relieved to hear that it was localised and hadn't spread anywhere. He seems very upbeat about it.

I can't help but feel incredibly worried and frightened in spite of that. I know early stage prostate cancer is rarely treated, but is a 6 months wait appropriate? Is it likely to grow worse in this time? Are the chances good to 'cure' it? He told the doctor he's fine with getting the prostate cut out, but was told that that kind of treatment would carry all kinds of risks and he should just wait for his next appointment.",2021-08-04 19:40:08+00:00,"[""He is on active surveillance.

249,Concerned daughter,5,orup35,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/orup35/concerned_daughter/,10,"Hi there, my father (57) may have prostate cancer and this is the first time I'm directly dealing with the possibility of a loved one having cancer, so please bear with me! 

His PSA levels over the last couple of years were 1.4 > 1.4 > 2.5 > 10.0 this year, which prompted an MRI, PIRADS score was 3. He's getting a biopsy of course (scheduled in a month but trying to get that to be earlier...) According to the ""PHI"" score he has a 33.3% chance of having cancer. 

He leads a pretty healthy lifestyle, no drinking or smoking, gets regular exercise. He had a ""widow maker"" heart attack in January and had an emergency stent insertion which saved his life. So he's on blood thinners and a bunch of meds for that, and is also diabetic. Which I guess complicates things. 

I would appreciate any advice, statistics or perspectives, especially from folks with similar numbers or other accompanying conditions. I'm particularly concerned about the PSA quadrupling and how his other conditions might intersect with this. 

Also, if his PIRADS score is only 3 does that mean there's a low chance of the cancer having metastasized outside the prostate? 

And, what are the other reasons besides cancer that could be causing the PSA/ troublesome spots on the MRI?

Anyway, wondering from real-life what you'd offer me as advice on that front. My mind already leans towards surgery, as I would think I would continually worry ""did they get all the cancer"" or ""will it come back"" if they do radiation or seeds.

I ended up paying for a 2nd MRI because the 1st was so horrible ( 1.5T vs 3T Whole body diffusion MRI). The first MRI showed possible multiple lesions but the 2nd showed only 1 and the rest were blood clots from the blind biopsy. Also, my prostate was 4 times normal size ( over 100cc) which they felt should be reduced with ADT prior to surgery and/or radiation.  I ended up telling my medical oncologist that I wanted to take bicalutamide for 6 weeks prior to my procedure. I chose TULSA PRO ULTRASOUND which is much less invasive done by Dr. Joseph Busch in Alpharetta GA, USA. At the time ( December 2020), he was the only one doing GL 9.

I was recently diagnosed with (hopefully) early stage prostate cancer, Gleason 3+4=7, 2 cores, and bone/PT scans showed no spread yet (thankfully). Here's my question - is there any scientific basis to my concern that ejaculating soon after the biopsy (within 1-2 weeks) while I was still healing could somehow have increased my risk of accelerating any spread of cancer cells to other areas of my body? (and yes, the semen was quite quite bloody, which I both expected and was super shocked at)

I have no idea if there's any basis to my concern, so apologies if it's just inherently ridiculous.

262,DHT replacement therapy after radical prostatectomy?,4,miettz,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/miettz/dht_replacement_therapy_after_radical/,13,"I'm 64, white male in good health, no family history that I know of.

Coming up on two years ago, I was diagnosed with PC, encapsulated.  I just went for the full radical prostatectomy, with the fortunate outcome of all subsequent PSA tests coming back zero.  I'm now wondering about androgen replacement therapy, as my prostate no longer exists to supply dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  

My urologist casually commented one time that those who supply such supplements are ""committing legal murder"", as for someone with their prostate intact, he thinks it can aggravate the formation of cancer. After hearing that one, I'm afraid to ask him about it...even after a successful removal surgery by him.

But with the prostate gone; there's no longer any vessel for the cancer to form within.  I was wondering if this loss of DHT is something being skipped over by my medical professionals.  The few articles I've read say it can help some with depression and erections - but its too soon to say if taking it *after the prostatectomy*, if its still an aggravate to the formation of cancer perhaps elsewhere.

Frankly I'd rather not be a victim of ""fucked with it and found out"".  One the other hard, it feels like ""something's missing"" in the spring in my step.  Maybe ok to try and see if it does anything I feel is definitely worth a risk?  Life's a risk...

Scheduled a follow-up at age 39 because I had been having bouts of prostate ache that seemingly came outta nowhere. It happened a handful of times where I would get a painful ache in the prostate area and felt the need to urinate even though I didn't need to. I also was developed weak flow and trouble emptying the bladder, sometimes during the day, always at night. PSA was 1.2 and my doc said my prostate felt a little ""squishy"" and decided it was infected, gave me an anti-biotic and a sample of some high grade saw-palmetto from a local place (seemed fishy to me). I told him I had concerns about prostate cancer, asked about preventative treatments, surgery, etc. My thought is I don't need the stupid thing anymore, get this ticking timebomb out! He told me to exercise and eat healthy foods. I told him I had been exercising 3-4 times a week and eating healthy for years. Keep it up he said. I have no idea if the anti-biotics did anything, its not like I was in constant pain, just random bouts that happen once a month or so. Unsatisfied with my visit I tried saw-palmetto, that seemed to make my BPH symptoms worse. I did some research and tried pumpkin seed oil and that seemed to help for a while.

While radiation and surgery have similar 5 year results I wanted 30 year results and removing the cancer once and for all just made the most sense.  Bladder issues lasted a couple months.  Sexual disfunction continues to improve.  PSA is undetectable.  My doctors PA noted that with surgery symptoms start off as severe and get better.  With radiation they start minimal and increase.  With radiation you rule out surgery if the radiation doesn't work.  If you have surgery you can always move to radiation.  I suppose at the end of the day you have to decide how aggressive you want to be with treatment.  The good news is you don't have to rush your treatment.  I'd recommend look at the Prostate Cancer Foundation web site as it is loaded with information.  I'd also recommend for with a leading medical center not a local regional hospital.

Otherwise, putting something under the foot of the mattress to lift the feet a few inches helps.\n\n\\- Understand and organize pain medications!!! This is super important. Most people don\'t have too much discomfort after their discharge-- I did. It became important to have a written log for pain medications-- I was taking three different pills: Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and Oxycodone.\n\n\\- Talk to a nurse or pharmacist about how to manage the dosing of these drugs, and clarify with the surgical team just what they do/don\'t want you to take, and on what schedule.  Some docs are hestitant about Ibuprofen -- and to be clear, Aspirin is a NEVER for surgical recover; that urethra has the form clots and heal, and aspirin interferes with clot formation.\n\nThe story with pain is that its MUCH easier to ""get ahead of it"" than it is to ""knock it down"" once its gotten bad.

Tastes like a cherry milkshake. One of my docs and the discharge paperwork said senna laxative but that didn’t do a thing for me. MOM was wonderful. He’ll probably have bladder spasms but they will go away in time. Get some regular neosporin and have him squirt a bit into the tip of his urethra opening which keeps the catheter lubricated well. Makes it way more comfortable. Always wash hands before doing this. Don’t need any yucky getting on the catheter that slides inside the body. Baggy sweat pants work well. I chose not to do the underwear that first week. If memory serves, unless I went outside my attire was a robe. That’s it. LOL. I needed comfort without irritation and that worked well for me. He needs to drink lots of water and beverages. Got to keep the kidneys flushed out. Have some pads or depends ready for the day the catheter comes out. I was one of the lucky few. I have never experienced leakage. But I had everything handy just in case. If he’s a brief type guy, the Depends real fit underwear are a great choice. Depends pads maximum are bulky but very good. Store brand pads are good as well. For security at work I use Walgreens pads but have never had leakage. Still scared a bit that a sudden move or reach will trigger leakage.

While I don’t want distance to bias my decision, I do think both have a good track record. the penn doctor has 1500 robotics under his belt, while the local has 500.

One factor would be trying to get others to drive me and pick me up. Since many of the procedures won’t allow me to drive afterwards. I’m sure that’s bit a problem to get the help.

If you know any, urology residents and OR nurses tend to be informed about ""who\'s best"" and they are often more willing to talk frankly.\n\nData suggest that substantial surgeon-to-surgeon variability in outcomes exist, even among high volume surgeons, but the easiest choice to make is ""pick someone who does this a lot as opposed to does this occasionally"". All other things being equal, I\'d pick someone in their forties or early fifties in age-- you\'d prefer someone who trained on robotic procedures rather than invest a lot of time in other techniques, and who has the stamina to be super driven about getting details right. I\'d also pick a hospital where they do this a lot -- you want a surgical team that works together on this stuff every day. This is a procedure where small details matter a lot getting this surgery right requires a lot of people working together smoothly.\n\nYou don\'t have to have your follow up with your surgeon -- I have a local urologist here, but flew across country to have the surgery done at Johns Hopkins. If I had to have radiation or other therapy, I\'d do that here. Once your surgeon has done his thing, you\'re very likely done with him-- whether the disease is cured, recurs, or progresses, there\'s typically not much more for a surgeon to do for a prostate CA patient.

After that, assuming everything goes well, there will be one more appointment for the 10-day recheck and catheter removal, and that might be another round trip, or could be done perhaps by your local urologist.  I would think that any emergencies could be handled at your local hospital, even if your surgery was in Philly (I actually did have emergencies due to blood clots that blocked my urethra).\n\nIf you need follow-up radiation, you could have that done locally -- in my case, the radiation oncologist would be a completely different person than the surgeon, if I ever get to that point (at 3 months post-RP, my PSA is undetectable).

283,Grandpa diagnosed with prostate cancer,4,janqic,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/janqic/grandpa_diagnosed_with_prostate_cancer/,12,"Hi everyone

So I am very new to this topic. I found out my Grandpa (77 y.o) was just diagnosed with prostate cancer. According to my grandma, his prostate is ""full of cancer."" And he has a spot on a rib. That sounds like stage 4 to me? He had scans of lungs, lymph nodes, bones and 1 spot came up on the ribs, no where else.

The plan of treatment is to have hormone injections every 6 months for 2 years. Oral medications and radiation. Did not hear anything about chemo. 

I did not want to pry into the situation and bombard them with questions because it is of course very upsetting. I didnt want to ask them questions like prognosis and what not. I know you are not doctors and cant give legitimate medical advice. But can someone please tell me how serious this sounds, what kind of prognosis is likely? I know it cannot be cured, treatment aims to stop pain and extend life. But I have no idea what to expect in the coming months and years. 

Any insight would be very much appreciated. Thank you all!",2020-10-13 22:11:54+00:00,"['I found out January 13th 2019 I had metastasized prostate cancer, seven spot on my skeleton.

That\'s the bad news. The good news is that, given his age, he may well end up dying of something else; this sounds perverse and not at all like good news, but that\'s the way cancer works.\n\nQuite often, in an older patient, there will be an ""incurable"" cancer which will nonetheless not shorten their life. An average 77 year old male, without prostate cancer, would be expected to live another ten years or so. That\'s an average-- some would die sooner, some would live longer . . . but you get the point. At 77, no one can reasonably say ""I expect to live another twenty years"" -- even if a few people do.\n\nProstate cancer, even advanced cancer, will generally respond to hormone therapies -- at least for a while, and sometimes for many years.\n\nSo, your grand-dad is here now, and one day, like all people, he won\'t be. His docs will manage this the best that they can-- and prostate cancer has got a lot of research spending and new drugs and therapies coming along quite quickly.\n\nSo, really, not all that much has changed. At age 77, you\'re likely in your last innings, whether you have cancer or not. Bad things can happen to anyone of that age-- this could be something that shortens his life. . .  but maybe not. My grand-dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his 70s, had surgery, then radiation, then hormone treatment . . . ended up dying of something unrelated in his 90s. He didn\'t exactly enjoy his cancer -- its no fun-- but he did enjoy his life.\n\nThere are statistics on all these things, but they don\'t really matter to you -- have fun with your granddad now, which is what you\'d want to do anyway.', 'Unfortunately it sounds like he has metastatic disease. \n\nHormone therapy will prevent the cancer from growing for some indeterminate period of time after which it will become castrate-resistant.

Some people go on intermittent hormone therapy and have no progression for years and years, others become castrate resistant almost immediately.\n\nRadiation, chemotherapy and other treatments like radium may be used to alleviate pain, but they also come with their own set of side-effects.

However, once treatment is completed, the side efffects mostly resolve themselves. \n\nIn 2 more years, if I stay in remission, (and so far, indications are great!), then I will be CURED!\n\nYes, that is the word the doctors used, CURED! \n\nKeep the faith.', 'Chemo doesn’t have much of an effect on PC.

287,ADT and medicare (USA).,5,id0g9p,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/id0g9p/adt_and_medicare_usa/,11,"My father has been battling advanced prostate cancer for the past year.   It was locally advanced and had spread to the lymph nodes, they removed the prostate and pelvic nodes, did radiation therapy, and he's now on hormone therapy for the foreseeable future.   His employers insurance covered the surgery, injections, and radiology with no out of pocket after he hit his deductible.  The good news is he's responding well to therapy and his PSA is near undetectable.  

He just retired this week and is trying to transition to medicare.  He's finding out with the highest plan and supplemental it's going to cost him $12k a year for coverage and the medications alone will cost over $50k USD a year!  It's sounding to me like medicare does not cover the androgen suppression shots he's getting.  

Has anyone here dealt with hormone therapy and medicare in the US?   How does one afford it?",2020-08-20 00:55:44+00:00,"[""My dad has stage 4 prostate cancer and he is low income, exclusively lives on social security about 13k a year and we've gotten through thanks to medicare, Medicaid and hospital financial assistance programs. \n\nWe've never had coverage issues with his hormone shots. I think they actually get billed as part of his office visits and not as a prescription? I handle his mail and have never seen bills that are specifically for his hormone shots so I think it must be included in the office cost which is the typical 80/20 medicare split. For us, the 20% that he typically would need to pay is covered by the hospital financial assistance program. We do still get the bills even though they are paid for us, and I know his visits that include the hormone shots are around $240 bills. He's on a generic version of Eligard. Anyway, if your dad's coverage for his doctors visits are more affordable that may be alright as it may not go through the supplemental/prescription portion of his insurance?\n\nBut also wanted to share our experience with expensive stuff on the prescription side of medicare. My dad was on zytiga for a while which is a hormone pill type thing that they try after casodex quits working, but one that is more rare and so you have to get it through a specialty pharmacy instead of a local pharmacy. The regular retail value of Zytgia like $10k a month or something, its insanely expensive. They gave us paperwork stating that price when we first were told about Zytgia so being handed that piece of paper when the man who needs this medication makes that much money a YEAR is pretty overwhelming even when you know you have prescription coverage through medicare. It just so happened that his need to switch to Zytgia was happening right when his yearly window for changing his prescription plan was happening. So we thought we might be able to switch his prescription plan to best cover Zytgia. \n\nWhen looking at prescription coverage options, some were free to him (because of his low income I think?), but we didn't want to just choose the free plan if that would have terrible coverage of Zytgia while another plan that cost a monthly fee would cover zytgia better. So we specifically were looking up the cost of that medication in the various plans, and most listed it at a $300-something a month though others listed it in the thousands. Even the cheapest plans that quoted $300 would be too expensive for my dad to afford on his income. So I tried calling some of the companies that offered medicare supplement plans to specifically ask them if there was anything they could do to assist with this zytgia expense if we did choose their plan. And none of them offered anything beyond payment plans. However, multiple of them told me that with medications that go through specialty pharmacies may have prices listed, but those can be very inaccurate because they haven't had special approval for a doctor, like you would if you had that insurance. IT's quite silly, you basically have to have the doctor tell the specialty pharmacy that these ungodly expensive medications are actually needed (as if doctors would prescribe them if they weren't needed?). but for whatever reason, that approval letter is needed to give a 'true' price quote. Which of course was not very helpful at all because...we couldn't get an approval before having the insurance, so we couldn't know what the cost would be WITH an approval until after we had chosen a plan...and then we wouldn't be able to switch for a year if it was a bad deal. Anyway, he just stuck with the plan he had been on the previous year, because it had a somewhat lower cost for the zytiga listed (i think $360?) and once it started and he got on Zytgia, the actual expense was $8 a month. If it had really been $360 a month, I would have contributed what I could to help, as would others who love him. But man, it was such a relief that it was $8 and that he could pay for it himself because he just is not the type of guy who wants to ask for help from anyone. \n\nObviously this is entirely anecdotal. But I guess my main point is to call and really look into the quotes you're seeing and see if the shot is being considered a 'specialty' med and if the quoted price will change with doctor approval, etc. I hope that's the case for you guys like it was for us."", ""Oh man, what a sad situation.

Go get a second opinion with a good urologist.', '  \n\n**Below ‘memo’ is long so will send as 3 ‘comments’ – very on point with your father’s issue & believe will be very useful.**\n\n**PART 1 - Memo – re: screening and diagnosing prostate cancer** (with endnotes for those interested in more detail): \n\nProstate cancer (“PCa”) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.\n\nMy recent experience of a diagnosis of PCa—and consequent prostatectomy—has led me to adopt the often-heard refrain of many activists, “If sharing my experience helps just one person, it’s worth it.” \n\nFor many years my annual PSA values had been consistently good—ranging between 1.8 and 2.1. Most recently, at age 69, the value increased to 3.05, which is well below the age-adjusted ‘standard/acceptable’ range of ≤ 4.5. The physical exam (DRE) was normal, and there were no PCa-related symptoms. During my GP’s review of the annual blood test results, he offered no comment about the comparatively elevated 3.05 value. \\[Of note, and not uncommon in the medical community, he generally discourages routine PSA testing altogether.[\\[i\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn1)\\] The higher PSA value, however, continued to bother me, and two months later I arranged to meet with him to discuss my concern. Despite my family history of PCa, he did not recommend a retest, but reluctantly agreed. That result (3.15) was only 0.1% higher, and his response was essentially, “See, no problem.” This was appeasing for a while, but it still gnawed at me, and four months afterward I returned and insisted on getting another test. \n\nDamned if that didn’t come in at 4.85 … and I was ‘off to urology.’ \n\nAlthough PSA tests often accurately indicate the presence/absence of PCa, it is generally acknowledged that the tests have a relatively high incidence of returning false-positive/false-negative results. My false-negative value was nevertheless quite valuable, i.e., the elevated value from the previous year was *possibly provocative*, and was the catalyst for receiving lifesaving treatment. As I subsequently learned, PSA test results point only towards the advisability of getting other types of blood and urine tests also useful in determining the possibility of PCa. One of the additional tests ordered by the urologist (together with another PSA retest (5.71)) is named, “Free PSA.”[\\[ii\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn2) He found this value (7%) to be “particularly concerning.” Searching further online, a ‘concerning’ Free PSA value can often be highly correlative to the presence of high-risk/aggressive PCa, and thus his strong encouragement to explore further with prostate imaging.\n\nUltrasound[\\[iii\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn3) is the most common prostate diagnostic imaging method used in the U.S. However, in the past few years, *diagnostic* MRIs for PCa[\\[iv\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn4) are being used more and more frequently. Currently, most insurers will initially deny coverage.[\\[v\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn5) I opted to pay the cost ($3,750-reimbursed after determination of PCa), and upon scheduling, also arranged to become a new patient of one of a handful of U.S. world-class urologists/surgeons (and thereafter couldn’t feel in better hands). \n\n\n\n**PART 3 MEMO ENDNOTES**\n\n**\\[i\\]** **Routine** **PSA testing** – is discouraged by the American Academy of Family Physicians. For ages 55-69, the AAFP advises: “There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small … we do not recommend routine PSA-based prostate cancer screening;"" and for age ≥70, “… currently recommends against the service … there is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.” The AAFP’s primary concern is the risks of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. **In my case, my ‘net benefit’ from routine PSA testing was** ***exceedingly beneficial*****!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**\\[ii\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_ednref2) **Free PSA** – more particularly, “free-to-total PSA ratio.” PCa risk calculators are available online ([http://riskcalc.org/PCPTRC/](http://riskcalc.org/PCPTRC/)), and are often used by physicians. Using my stats (PSA 5.71, age 69, normal DRE, family history), my calculated risk of PCa is shown as: “11% chance of high-grade PCa; 25% chance of low-grade; and 64% chance that the biopsy is negative.” However, when only my Free PSA value (7%) is added, the results become: “36% chance of high-grade PCa; 55% chance of low-grade; and 9% chance that the biopsy is negative.” Overall risk of PCa changes from 36% to 91%!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**\\[iii\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_ednref3) **Ultrasound imaging/biopsies** – commonly follow concerning PSA values, especially when accompanied with symptoms and/or when other tests so indicate. Ultrasound provides relatively poor quality images, and ‘suspicious areas’ in the prostate are often missed. If the ultrasound procedure does not indicate abnormal tissue, it is nevertheless common to randomly biopsy the four prostate quadrants. Because they are random, however, malignant tissue only millimeters away from the biopsy sites can easily be missed, and false-negative results are all too frequent. \\[Just one person’s ‘for what it’s worth’ note on the biopsy procedure, mine was only once slightly uncomfortable for 2-3 seconds, and totally painless.\\]\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**\\[iv\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_ednref4) **MRIs** – unlike ultrasound, are non-invasive, and more importantly, provide far better image quality. Better imaging has three main advantages: 1) evidencing abnormal tissue otherwise not shown with ultrasound; 2) if nothing looks amiss, the physician has a higher degree of confidence in determining whether random biopsies are at all necessary, thereby avoiding altogether an unnecessary biopsy and its concomitant invasiveness, the (2-5%) risk of infection, and rare instances of false-positives; and 3) if a lesion is shown, sophisticated software enables the subsequent biopsy samples to be taken from exact ‘target’ locations more clearly shown on the MRI. A few medical practices in the U.S. are equipped to perform both the MRI and biopsies simultaneously in real time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**\\[v\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_ednref5) **MRI insurance coverage** – may initially be denied. However, often the claims will subsequently be accepted upon a “peer-to-peer review” between the insurer and physician. Apparently the trend is towards full coverage by all insurers—hopefully realized before long. In the meantime, costs can also be mitigated by shopping for a less expensive imaging facility.', '  \n\n**PART 2 MEMO**\n\nAll tests and imaging up to this point in time are done for the sole purpose of determining whether it is then prudent to biopsy prostate tissue.\n\nThe MRI, which did indicate a “suspicious lesion,” was reviewed by two radiologists (one by the first urologist’s dept. which ordered it, and the second by the ‘world-class’ urologist’s dept.). When a lesion is evident, the radiologist will assign a “PI-RADS score” of 1 to 5. Although both radiologists used the same MRI, one ‘read’ of the lesion was “PI-RADS 2” (meaning, ‘probably benign’ and biopsy not necessarily indicated), and the other was “PI-RADS 4” (‘probably malignant’ and biopsy definitely advised). Big difference! The biopsy results confirmed PCa in 2 quadrants (Gleason Score 7 (4+3)). Further genomic testing[\\[i\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hbmfgm/help_with_what_next_step_should_be_psa_level/#_edn1) of the tissue samples identified the type of cancer as “high-risk and aggressive,” whereby treatment was definitely required. Various less-invasive treatments were discussed, researched, and rejected. One alternative of note was ‘laser ablation’ offered by a specialty clinic (with a high-profile online presence). Laser and other ablation techniques are most often used for treating lower-risk types of cancers found in relatively small area(s) of the prostate. They can be an attractive alternative because they do not have, or have to a lesser degree, the (often temporary) urinary incontinence and ED side effects of prostate removal. The clinic’s surgeon/owner reviewed my MRI and test results, assured me, ‘yes, you’re a good fit for our treatment,’ and fully encouraged my traveling for his procedure \\[cost 25k - not covered\\]. This prompted my getting a second opinion from the head of Cleveland Clinic Urology. He confidently recommended a prostatectomy, and as later evidenced by the post-surgical pathology, the ablative route would have been a serious mistake. \n\nPrimary takeaways from the forgoing are:\n\n\\- Neither high, nor low, PSA values are *reliable* indicators of the presence or absence of PCa. The PSA test is, however, importantly and deservedly the gold standard **first step** in determining one’s risk of having PCa. A substantial number (perhaps a majority) of doctors in the U.S. continue to be strong proponents of routine testing for all men over 50. \n\n\\- If the PSA value is the least bit concerning, and/or there is a family history of PCa, and/or there are other indications one may be at higher risk, **be certain to ask about—and seriously consider getting (either annually or periodically)—other tests**, even if they’re not covered and a few dollars come out-of-pocket. Physicians (possibly overly conscious of insurance company scrutiny of their ‘tests ordered’ metrics), might very well push back. With the advent of diagnostic MRIs and the availability of other tests, the number of unnecessary biopsies has been significantly reduced, thus weakening ‘old school’ physicians’ rationale for not testing. Regardless of the doctor’s preference, **all testing decisions are made by the patient.** \n\nWith relative certainty, had I deferred to the GP’s twice-given advice not to retest, I would have then been dealing with life-threatening advanced Stage 4 PCa at the next annual physical. Because the GP had not even mentioned—much less recommended—any of the additional tests available, many months passed unnecessarily before surgery. **Time is of the essence.**\n\n\\- Get second (possibly third) opinions from urologists … and radiologists.\n\n\\[Regarding my current status, the surgeon was surprised that the pathology indicated PCa outside of the prostate in one of the routinely dissected lymph nodes. Disappointing, but nevertheless treatable should subsequent PSA testing indicate a presence elsewhere. Recently, he offered, “The fact that you have no PSA value months after surgery is hugely positive!” This can, of course, change. Regardless, I’m doing fine and fully expect at least another two decades.\\] \n\nThis is simply a unilateral ‘fyi message,’ and no one should feel the least bit obliged to respond.    \n\n\n**\\[i\\]** **Genomic testing** –  has experienced breakthrough advances in recent years, enabling far greater accuracy (via biopsy samples) in identifying and differentiating the types of PCa, further classified on a scale of low-risk to high-risk.

Radical prostatectomy -- Removal of the entire prostate with a lymph node dissection. Most commonly in America this is done robotically. Cure rates are excellent. Notable side effects are incontinence and impotence, both of which improve with time after surgery, but could still be very bothersome depending on how well he recovers.\n3.

I am so glad that I found this community! My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year. He had another biopsy last month, was told that he has intraductal carcinoma and that it has likely spread to his lymph nodes. He has a gleason score of 7. I want to learn more about his condition and find out how I can best support him. I tried to look this type of cancer up and I could not find much information on it (or at least information I could understand). I was wondering if any of you have experienced this type of cancer, what your treatment plan was like, what your experiences were, how the treatment impacted you, any resources you may have, and any other information that may be helpful. I know that my dad's treatment plan could be different and that radiation impacts everyone differently. With the corona virus, my dad's appointments with his radiologist and oncologist have been postponed. But, most importantly, I want to know how I can best support my dad. He lives far away and is essentially on his own.  I just had a baby and can't travel. We have yet to determine if his cancer is androgen resistant and he has a low PSA number. I would greatly appreciate any insights! Thank you for taking the time to read this post!

Update: 
I was able to speak with two of my dad's doctors, with his permission of course. My dad has a gleason of 7 (4+3). He has intraductal carcinoma, even with this gleason score, which is rare. He has only had an MRI of his pelvis. They have not looked at all of his lymph nodes, just a few. This is why my dad told me they thought it was in his lymph nodes, because he thought that, because they wanted to do more testing, that he thought it indicated it was in his lymph nodes. (I'm glad that was cleared up). He is going for an advanced PET scan and a bone scan within the next few weeks to look at all of his lymph nodes and bones to ensure it hasn't metastasized. He is starting back up on Lupron and Cosidex (phonetically spelled). He is also going to start two months of radiation in a month. Thank you all so much for your insights!! If you have any ideas on how I can best support him during his time, please let me know!!

Similar to your dad my cancer had already spread to a nearby lymph node. I just had a radical prostatectomy on Monday whereas the prostate was removed along with nearby lymph nodes. I’ve also been on “hormone therapy” for four months. Prostate cancer requires testosterone to grow. Hormone therapy stops the body from producing it - slowing the growth of the cancer.\n\nI’m obviously not a doctor but what I would recommend first is your dad getting at least 2-3 second opinions from other oncologists. You’ll find that each one will have a different opinion.\n\nSecond, join some good forums.  [Zero : The End of Prostate Cancer](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zeroconnect/?ref=share) and [The Prostate Cancer Foundation](www.pcf.org)  are both excellent resources.\n\nThird, don’t look at the statistics. Just don’t. They’re dated and if there’s one thing I’ve realized every case is unique and every patient different. If there’s any proof to this it’s the handful of survivor blogs that I’ve read.

Such a plan could include surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy.\n\nDetermining whether the cancer is ""androgen resistant"" isn\'t a thing. Prostate cancer is all androgen sensitive, until it isn\'t. This is based on how the patient responds to hormone therapy in a situation where curative therapy isn\'t an option. Initially the patient will respond and the disease will go into remission. However, that remission may last a year or five years. At some point, though, the hormone treatment will stop working because the cancer no longer needs testosterone to fuel its growth. At that time it is then considered castrate resistant (no longer sensitive to hormones).', 'Fortunately the cancer grows slowly and you don’t have to make rash decisions.

Even though my PSA was in the ""normal"" range, it had been rising quickly over two previous physicals.

That alarmed my primary care doctor who sent me to a urologist. He also ran a PSA showing normal range. He also gave me two choices:

1. More frequent monitoring.
2. Biopsy.

Being a Stage 2 colon cancer survivor, I prefer knowing what's going on and I pushed for the biopsy. That's when they discovered three cores with cancer, two of which were agressive.

Because of my colon cancer surgery -- and then repair surgery -- 23 years ago, I had too much scar tissue and Kevlar to have a prostatectomy.

Rather than simply accept the treatment procedure my urologist recommended, my husband and I interviewed three different physicians and protocols. The doctors were not used to this medical consumer approach.

We selected a 90-day injection and oral bicalutamide protocol followed by 30 proton beam-guided radiation treatments, daily M-F.

Bicalutamide had some minor side effects for me (menopause hot flashes in the middle of a business meeting were my favorites to explain away).

The proton therapy also had some side effects I hope will be improving: frequent urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, urgency, minor bowel incontinence. 

I have gotten back to the gym three times this week. That seems to have helped some.

He recently saw one surgeon that said he thought he could remove the whole prostate and said he should think about hormone therapy (finally).

My partner and I have had a cancer diagnosis looming for the past six months or so. We finally got our official diagnosis today. I want to say thank you to you all because I was able to go into our appointment with knowledge and a clear head. I really appreciate you all sharing resources and so much of your experiences. Thank you.

I'm here now looking for a support, a sense of community, and general advice going forward.

So my partner, 41, very fit and healthy (runner), was diagnosed with T2 N0 M0 Gleason 6 cancer. Of the 14 cores that were taken 8 had cancerous cells. Six were 5% or less Gleason 6. Two that were on the lesion site that was visible on his MRI contained 80% Gleason 6. His PSA when it was last checked a few months ago was a bit above 4 if I recall correctly.

My partner's maternal grandfather and uncle both died of prostate cancer. 

Our doctor has not recommended any further scans as the MRI showed a clear lesion site (PI-RADS 4) and no metastasis outside the prostate. Is this normal? Should we be asking for a CT scan or bone scan?

He mentioned Polaris testing, but said it might not yield any new information. 

Our doctor talked about active surveillance and how that's usually recommended for older men, so he recommended the robotic prostate surgery. Preferably sooner rather than later (within six months, no later than a year). Our doctor had not heard about the gold nanoparticle treatment clinical trials (should that give us pause?).

Our doctor has a great bedside manner and thoroughly explained things to us and answered all our questions. He's done around a 1,000 of the robotic surgeries. 

We're meeting with radiologists, just to gather more information even though my partner prefers surgery over radiation. 

What do we do from here? Should we shop around for surgeons (please DM yours if you had a good experience!)? Do we get second opinions? We're gonna go freeze his sperm soon, so that's on the checklist. Anything else? Is it worth talking to someone about alternative therapies like the nanoparticle treatment?

Most of these are read by the local path lab. Reading these slides is very much a judgment call-- the difference between pattern 3 and pattern 4 is ""what it looks like to the pathologist"" -- there are a set of guidelines, but it's very different than a PSA, the number comes from a human, not from an automated repeatable process. There can be and are differences between readings. In this all important pattern 3/4 distinction, somewhere between a quarter to a half of the samples will be up or downgraded on a repeat reading-- a big distinction, considering how differently you treat (3+3) and (3+4) or (4+3).

Many community pathologists will be reading all kinds of slides, skin biopsies, breast biopsies, etc . . . but there are also dedicated uropathologists who only look at prostate slides, and if you've got one of these ""on the line"" cases, you should consider getting your tissue samples to experts for a second look.

This is by a well respected hospital. The pathology report showed Gleason 3+4. I decided to get a second opinion and requested the samples from the original pathologist. They were delivered to my selected second opinion provider who did not find cancer in any of the samples. I had to undergo another biopsy which came back Gleason 6 (3+3) in two cores.  So, it seems to me that the original pathologist sent the wrong samples for the second opinion.', 'My first pathology (local hospital, local pathologist) read Gleason 6, 5 of 12 cores, both sides of the prostate.  They recommended surgery.  Second opinion (major hospital in Boston)--only 3 positive cores, all on one side, still Gleason 6.  Everyone gave a sigh of relief and recommended active surveillance.  Before I even got home, however, I got the results of my most recent PSA--up from 7.1 to 8.6 in three months. So, new recommendation was for an endorectal MRI.  That showed three large lesions, one pressing against the ""wall"" of the prostate.  Both oncologists (one medical, one radiation), who had been leaning toward ""watchful waiting"" after the second pathology report, now recommended treatment.  My surgeon told me he no longer believed the cancer was Gleason 6.  As he said, he\'d seen a lot of MRIs, and he\'d never seen one that looked like mine turn out to be Gleason 6.  He was right.  Post prostatectomy score--Gleason 7 (3+4).\n\nThe problem is even the best pathologist in the world is only seeing a small sample of the cancer.  About 25% of the time they\'re wrong--and they\'re almost always wrong in underestimating the severity of the cancer.  The only way to really know is post-surgical pathology. But, of course, that doesn\'t help someone trying to decide *whether* to have surgery (or other treatment).  So, I agree on getting multiple opinions and second and even third pathology reports.

352,HIFU - High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,4,pxhoph,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/pxhoph/hifu_high_intensity_focused_ultrasound/,14,"So, at age 48 I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, six of the twelve samples came back positive and it was all the way across the prostate. The doctor suggested I look into the HIFU, or High Intensity Focused Ultrasound as the damage done while ablating the prostate is minimal to the surrounding nerves.

Long story short, after months of research and talking to other people who had it done, I opted for the procedure, even though my insurance refused to pay for it.

The HIFU has a long history of success and can even be used for recurrent prostate cancer.  The FDA approved the procedure in 2015 and the AMA released the codes for it earlier this year.

I had the procedure done with a PSA of 6.5 and spent the next couple years in what I felt was recovery. I developed mild ED which can happen with a total ablation and I treat it as needed with a microdose of a generic Cialis (like less than 5mg).  Having the procedure will take away your ability to ejaculate, but honestly after a while I got used to it and the orgasms are just as intense.  

The best part is I don't have to wear a diaper and the ablation actually works in your favor in case your prostate is enlarged.

Two years later and my PSA is negligible and I try to evangelize to others about this procedure.

Insurance has started to take responsibility; I went through four levels of appeal and finally I won, but only about a third of the payment was returned. But hey, if it saves your life and means you don't have to wear a diaper or get cut up, why not?",2021-09-28 22:32:42+00:00,"['6 months ago I knew very little about the competing interests of various treatments for PC. I had never heard of HIFU. You should know this going in.  If your particular provider doesn’t offer HIFU you will probably be lied to. \n\nWhile HIFU is fairly new, it is not experimental. If your provider says they don’t offer it bc it’s experimental, they are not that stupid and you are being lied to. Medicare does not pay for experimental, and they just paid for my HIFU, (their billing code: CPT 55880)\n\n If you stumble onto the Prostate Cancer Foundation website, PCF.ORG,  they will condemn HIFU and even state that it is not FDA approved. Not only is that incorrect, the two hospitals in Los Angeles which they recommend for PC treatment (UCLA and USC) both offer HIFU.  UCLA still has their ancient videos posted from 2016 when they got their HIFU device. \n\nSince medicare jumped in, some private insurers are now paying for HIFU bc it’s dramatically cheaper. For many years, private (pay as you go) clinics have offered HIFU for about $25k. My HIFU at Cedars, often called the most expensive hospital in California, was under $5k. \n\nWhile manufacturers like Sonablate and Ablatherm certainly have patents on their devices, the process itself has been around since the 50’s and cannot be patented or copyrighted. \n\nHIFU is not a magic bullet either.

For example, no one advised that the Gleason score on a biopsy can be downgraded to something less severe when the pathology report comes out after they've removed your prostate.  That can make a difference in how one decides about the surgery.\n\nHaving been through this, I wish the process involved a specialist practitioner who could walk you through your activities of living that bring you joy, and ensure that you understand the possible impacts on those, because while it's nice that surgeons claim they want to save you from cancer, are you sure your quality of life afterwards will be what you expect?

A month ago i had all symptoms of a UTI (after sex with my girlfriend) like frequent urination, disconfort in testicles, groin and sometimes abdominal, some post void dribbling. So afraid of being cancer i went to urologist that said to me: you're too young (27M). It's not impossible but so so unlikely. Told me to get 15 days of antibiotics. Also my GP did me a DRE and told me that was looking normal.
After the 15 days i was feeling a little bit better and some mild symptoms on and off but no disconfort whatsoever. And decided to have sex again with my GF but protected now. 
The symptoms came back: no pain, no disconfort but frequent urination and, for me it is the worst, post void dribbling to a point i get my underwear kinda wet.

There are definitely spots that concern me. I will be talking to my urologist tomorrow, but I was also curious to hear what experienced folks on this stream thought.

(Edit- just talked to urologist, tried to reassure me. Said due to how much manipulation/beating up of prostate happens as they remove it, the margins/invasion findings may not mean that there are cells in my body. Also reiterated that next step no matter what is to get PSA to see what's left, in 3 months, and from there, radiation is possible if any PSA appears.. I'm still worried, frankly.)

I'm curious also if I should be looking for oncologists... I'm assuming it's best to go to a reputable place but I don't know how to even approach trying to get a consultation there. If anyone has experience - for reference, I live in VA but can travel if needed.

In any case, the things that concern me most from my report are:

* Notes re: the ""invasion of left bladder neck""... doesn't this actually mean that there are definitely still prostate cancer cells in my body?
* The two places of positive margins (limited yes, but still in bladder neck and left anterior)... this to me means we didn't get all of the cells esp given that there is more than one positive margin.
* The pT3a classification... which I believe means I have stage IIIa cancer. I read contradictory info online about how curable this is... What should I expect this summer, is radiation in my future? How serious should I consider all this? Who should be my next call?

He is still in the hospital. Ileus has been gone for a couple days now. Then he spiked fevers, increased abdominal distention and increased pain again. They got a second CT and figured out he has a pocket of infection (pus, blood, urine) in his abdomen that is cause of his lingering problems!! They are planning on placing a drain today and then he should make a full recovery!!! Weird turn of events. This is definitely not a typical course of recovery. Thanks all for your advice and support! ❤️

ORIGINAL POST: My father is 64 and had a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy almost 6 days ago. He was doing OK the first few nights in the hospital and was discharged post-op day 2. 

Within 6 hours of being home his catheter stopped draining. His belly became even more distended, and he had bladder spasms. He thought he needed to have a BM, but nothing was happening. His surgeon told us to go to the ED since maybe the catheter had a clot stuck, and it needed to be flushed.

I wish it was just that simple. He had to be readmitted for bad kidney labs, IV fluids, and pain control. Later they figured out urine was leaking into his abdominal cavity. Through the unhealed urethra! What the heck?! Poor guy! This was completely unexpected. 

His urologist said it was the worst timing for a bladder spasm. It normally causes urine to drip around the catheter, but being 2 days post-op, the urine leaked out his sewed up urethra at the base of the bladder. My dad’s prostate was also enlarged so the surgeon had a difficult time connecting the urethra anyway. 

They obtained a CT to confirm. Not enough of a collection to warrant another drain, but definitely confirmed urinary ascites. Ouch!

And now he is now facing a post-op ileus which is setting him back. More pain, bloating, nausea, lots of burps. NG tube in and helping his nausea, but no passing gas or BM yet. His belly looks HUGE and he normally has a basketball for a belly. This sucks. 

Silver lining is no cancer in lymph nodes, it was all removed with the prostate. But he’s gotta recover from the surgery first.

He did targeted radiation to that are twice, and his leg has been one of the biggest problems symptom-wise, but he didn't need surgery.

I give the credit to physical therapy with biofeedback.  I was RV camping again with friends and family at 30 days.\n\nAll in all, the only thing I really have lost is ejaculation.  At my age, it's actually kind of nice not making a mess any more. Yes I do have mild ED but a simple shot of bi-mix takes care of that. The shots are very easy and almost pain free.  They also last for several yours so there is no rush.\n\nYour life will be far from over. Yesterday I was riding my Goldwing motorcycle.  Today was 3 hours crawling under and out of my RV.

These tests look at the genes that are turned on or off within your cancer and can determine your relative risk of future progression.  \n\nProstate cancer does not often spread to the bladder. If your father was a smoker, his bladder cancer likely came from his tobacco use. It's one very interesting thing we see among smokers.

These were autopsy studies done amongst men who died randomly in large cities. What it goes to show you is that many prostate cancers grow very slowly and are often not found until something like a PSA test brings it to a doctor's attention. Although your PSA of five is high for your age, do remember that this elevation could be caused by other benign conditions in combination with the cancer, such as an infection or BPH.

I was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours, and it took a few weeks to feel normal, because it's major surgery and there is a lot of healing that needs to take place: incisions, bladder, urethra and various other abdominal things.\n\nMy best advice to you is to make sure that your father has support around the house for at least a week or two.  I needed someone to help me empty the catheter bag and the bag covering the Jackson drain hole. It was too uncomfortable to reach down or do anything that required lifting or even mild exertion (like making lunch). The catheter really gets in the way of moving around, so help was also needed changing clothes and showering. The support I had from my wife and 35-yr old son was absolutely amazing, and I think I healed better because I could focus on resting.  Your dad should abandon all expectations of doing anything productive during this time!  Just heal!\n\nAlso, some people mention switching from the day catheter bag to the big night one.  Honestly, just use the night bag all day long.  We kept it in a pail on the floor next to the lazyboy or my office desk during the day -- much less attention needed to empty it vs the little bag.\n\nBest of luck.

You should ask about and understand his Gleason Score which is an indicator of his prognosis and the appropriate course of treatment.\n\nThe MRI and bone scan will indicate whether his cancer is likely contained within the prostate and what the next steps (surgery and or radiation therapy) are needed. This, together with his Gleason Score, is the best indication of both spread and severity. \n\n I hope your dad does well; he is fortunate to have a caring and supportive family.', 'Need to know his prostate volume and gleason score as well as last 3 psa tests.

If you have read my previous posts you will know that I am a 68 yo man who was diagnosed with PC last year.  In March I had the RALP.  I have been tested since then for PSA levels and I guess the RALP was successful as PSA was indiscernible (less than 0.01). 

So I know I should be very happy.

But since then, I have been living in a sea of urine.  I don't mean stress incontinence, but total, permanent, overt incontinence, whether I am moving, standing still, lying down or sleeping.  I wear those adult diapers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and need to change them six times or so each day.  I have tried kegels to no avail.  My urologist prescribed me one of those electrostimulation devices for my perineum muscles and it has had no effect.  I smell like a clogged toilet all of the time.  I take frequent showers and the only result is that my shower stall now also smells permanently of urine.

Combined with some other problems in my personal life I won't bore you with here, I am living in perpetual misery because of this.

Despite anything I may have read elsewhere, this sort of ""total overt leaky faucet"" incontinence (as opposed to ""just"" stress incontinence) is extremely common among post-RALP patients and it could easily take six months or more to see ANY discernible improvement.  And yes, I can expect to be miserable throughout such period.  She actually pretty strongly recommended I see a psychiatrist if I had serious thoughts of doing way with myself and cheerfully reminded me that our local mental hospital was open 24 hours a day (thanks but no thanks, I\'ll bear it in mind as a last resort but not otherwise).\n2. She strongly recommended I go back on duloxetine (Cymbalta) which apparently is crap as an antidepressant but has been known to help for incontinence.  Start with 30 mg a day and if no undesirable effects, up to 60 mg.\n3. She doesn\'t know why the perineum electrostimulation device I am using has had no effect but she strongly recommended I see a physical therapist specialized in pelvic reeducation.  Unfortunately virtually all such specialists in France are more accustomed to dealing with urinary incontinence in women, but my PCP found one who at least mentions post-RALP men as people whom she (the physical therapist) treats.   So I will see that one.\n4. She recommended I do some serious toilet training -- just like toddlers, go to the bathroom once an hour, whether I feel the need to do so or not and try.\n5. She also recommended I drink less water -- no more than 1 litre (a little more than one quart) a day.  This is going to be extremely tough for me, as between sweating and urinating I lose a lot more than that a day.  \n\nWell, that\'s it.  I will give it the good old college try and keep you all informed.  \n\nI think one of the posters mentioned that incontinence puts a stop to one\'s sex life.

My dad is 70 years old with HTN and no other comorbidities. He is very active and doesn’t smoke. The only symptoms he has has are nocturia and other urine type symptoms. He has lost some weight but I don’t think it’s significant. 

My dad has high PSA levels. I think in the 200s if I remember correctly. That was at least one year ago, maybe two. He finally went to his urologist and got a biopsy. The urologist said he has mid grade or stage prostate cancer. And on may 20th (a month from now!!!) they will decide if he needs just surgery or radiation. 

My question is, what is this mid? When will they stage him? Should he get a PET scan or something? Why are they waiting a whole month? Does he have a good chance at survival? Also with this coronavirus going on, does radiation make him immunocompromised?

You should talk to your father or his urologist to try to get more specific information. More importantly, your father should get a second opinion before doing anything. He should see an oncologist, preferably two--a surgical oncologist and and radiological oncologist, before deciding what, if anything, to do. At the very least he should get a second opinion from another urologist. \n\nThat said, I will try to give you some general answers. What is this mid? No idea. It probably means Gleason 7. Prostate cancer is graded from Gleason 6 to 10. Gleason 6 probably doesn't require treatment. Gleason 8 to 10 absolutely require treatment. Gleason 7 is more complicated. \n\nWhat treatment he should have (and even whether he should get treatment at all) depends on a number of things besides his Gleason score. His PSA is important (200 is very high, but it can go into the thousands). Knowing whether the cancer has spread beyond the prostate is also important. If it has, surgery is not likely to benefit him. If it has spread into the area around the prostate, radiation might be called for.  If it has spread farther out, then usually you go right to hormone treatment. \n\nWhatever turns out to be the case, you should not panic. At your father's age, he is more likely to die with prostate cancer than from it. And at this point you really have no idea how bad his cancer is.

418,Orgasm after prostatectomy,4,g3tvk3,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/g3tvk3/orgasm_after_prostatectomy/,18,"May I take the liberty of using this sub to ask a rather embarrassing question?

Like many posters here, I have done the deed and have had the prostatectomy.  Subject to subsequent PSA testing, the odds seem to be (based on the pathologist's examination of the prostate) that I have beat the cancer, which is of course the most important point of all.  So I am grateful for that!

There is a tremendous amount of literature out there (and in responses to other posts on this sub) about the usual issues thereafter, namely recovering urinary continence and, ultimately, the ability to obtain and sustain an erection.   With respect to the latter, there are many explanations pointing out that erection, ejaculation and orgasm, although occurring simultaneously in most men before any prostate surgery, are entirely separate processes and therefore that men who have had prostatectomies should not lump them together, the idea being to reassure men that they can achieve orgasm without necessarily having an erection (and of course without ejaculation, which almost always is absent in post-prostatectomy men).

All this is of course very welcome information.  However, I have found next to nothing in the literature regarding at what time period following prostatectomy it would be normal to expect to achieve orgasm alone (with or without erection).  Oddly, more than one website specifically encourages masturbation following prostatectomy : there seems very much to be a ""use or it lose it"" philosophy.  But nobody seems to say with any precision just **when** this sort of activity is supposed to begin.   I am only three weeks past the prostatectomy so of course this is the least of my worries for the moment, but do any other denizens of the sub have any inkling of just when it is the right time to expect to begin such, ahem, ""activity""?   I have had two tries in the past week and they produced nothing but a vague sensation of discomfort.  My urologist assured me, following the operation, that all the relevant nerves had been fully spared.

At least a month. Completely without erection. Later with injections, pills, pumps I was able to have sex and orgasms, although it was always annoyingly complicated. Spontaneity was completely impossible. Also, I lost significant size after the surgery, so had to adjust to that. On the plus side, my orgasms are much stronger than they used to be, and once in awhile I'll have more than one. So I got that going for me. Which is nice.\n\nAnd there' no reason to apologize. Nobody likes talking about this stuff, but all of us need information, and, from experience and discussions with other patients, most doctors dont tell you much about post-prostatectomy life or help you prepare for it (some, I've heard, are very good about this, but I think they're still a minority).

It is a difficult, personal decision. Every treatment has side effects, many of them permanent, and life-changing. I'm a person who needs to understand what is happening, so I did a lot of research on my own. I began with the book Dr. Patrick Walsh's Surviving Prostate Cancer. It's a great place to start in understanding the disease, the various treatments and their possible side effects. From there I was on the internet a lot, reading NIH studies, looking at websites of various cancer hospitals (Memorial Sloan Kettering's site was particularly helpful). And I talked to as many doctors as I could--I got opinions from two urologists, a surgical oncologist and a radiation oncologist. I even asked my GP what he would do in my circumstances. If money had been no object I'm sure I would have tried to get at least one or two other opinions from experienced surgical and radiation oncologists. \n\nIn the end I went with surgery. It was important (to me) to know how bad the cancer really was, and the only way to do that is by removing the prostate so that a pathologist can look at the whole thing; it also seemed to me to offer the best chance of a cure, so long as the cancer was confined to my prostate itself (it was; however, my surgical margins were positive--so doubt remains). At my age, I was also concerned about the long term effects of radiation. \n\nAs for side-effects, that has been a mixed bag. I never experienced incontinence, and I am very grateful for that: the idea of having to wear a diaper at the age of 50 did not sit well with me. I did lose erectile function (almost inevitable, at least for awhile--with radiation side-effects like that may still happen, it just takes a few years for them to show up). Now, two years later, that function appears to be returning. I am also grateful for that. At the same time, I also developed Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis itself) which has caused me to lose quite a bit of size (they tell you you'll lose about 1/2 an inch--I lost more like 1 1/2) and, well, it's not shaped the way it used to be. I had no idea this was possible before hand, and it is the one thing that causes me to occasionally wonder if I made the right choice. \n\nBut even with that, I don't really regret the decision (I resent having to make the decision, but that's between me and the universe). In the end you can't know how you're going to respond to any treatment, or what side-effects you might end up with, or how serious they may be.

My doctor visits didn’t identify the source of my unwell state.  Sought out private clinic services to help, and they completed PSA as part of their standard suite of tests, 9.7 :(.

Exercise started quickly, and I was back to about 80% within 4 months.\n\nBut, there was positive contact margin and I never did get below 0.2 ng/L PSA. Rose to 0.4 ng/L at 5 months.  So salvage radiation kicked off at 6 months post RP.  Just finished 37 treatments by EBRT in conjunction with a 4 month ADT, which also went well due to the physical training.  So these side effects are tougher to explain as they build and there is really no obvious pain or even discomfort.  No incontinence but ED is near 100% at 3 months into the ADT.

During my ADT, I gained about 18 kilos in weight, and due to the side effects, I had some very serious mental health issues.

Looking for some advice for my dad(68).

I would consider asking about a re-test of his PSA and for them to double check that the pathology slides are in fact a genetic match to him. It's always good to be sure before undergoing life altering treatment.\n\nIf he has GS9 cancer, he should start ADT immediately, and undergo staging scans--CT / Bone scan to make sure that the cancer has not metastasized. If his scans are clean he will likely undergo extremely aggressive treatment, ADT (Hormone therapy) / chemo + surgery, radiation or both.\n\nIf the cancer has spread he will be given ADT / Chemo to slow the growth of the cancer. I will say, unfortunately, that typically patients who present with a low psa and extremely aggressive disease do not respond well to hormone therapy.

My doctor called and says his secretary will schedule the surgery to have it removed.  But now I'm facing a nightmare of putting up with catherer issues after the surgery plus the lingering fears from PSA recurrence. What am I to do? Should I go through with the prostate removal surgery or go for the radiation treatment? I got an email from someone I know who says survival rates of prostate cancer patients with DaVinci radical prostate removal is just 60 percent. While those who go for MRI radiation treatment the survival rate is 90 percent. Is that accurate and should I humbly submit to the radical prostectomy suegery or should I go for the MRI guided radiation treatment? I worry about the effects of the radiation on my bowel movements and going to the bathroom. So any suggestions?,2019-08-06 13:49:56+00:00,"[""First note: whoever your “friend” was sending you an email with a useless and incorrect stat — put him/her on your ignore list. The “survival rate” stats you’re citing are wrong, not even close.  Radiation and surgery are very similar in most cases.\n\nMeet with your doc - he'll give you better information, and he's the only one who's got the details on your path report- there's a lot there beyond Gleason score.\n\nIf you can, I'd recommend going to a comprehensive cancer center: Sloan Kettering, MD Anderson, Dana Farber, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland or Mayo Clinic, UCSF etc - these folks treat tens of thousands of men, and are data driven\n\nTalk to both oncologists and surgeons about your case and the stats, from people who aren’t randomly spouting nonsense\n\nThese folks, not your emailing friend, have real data and can advise you best on your case.\n\nFWIW - in a somewhat similar sounding case (but each case has to be evaluated on its own details), I chose surgery. The catheter after surgery is a week, typically, and while no one would say “that’s the best week of my life”- I’d characterize it as a nuisance, and then it’s over"", 'Good advise from this last response. I went with radiation implants and did not have  many side effects. Constipation  but very little discomfort other than that.  I  spoke wit docs from Swedish cancer in Seattle a cancer care alliance, Fred Hutchison Center. Make appointments with a few people. Take care', 'I did both — first the DaVinci surgery, then the radiation treatment.  Your “friend” is no authority; the survival rates for both are above 90 percent.\n\nBefore making a decision, I would try to find a surgeon with thousands of these procedures under his belt (as I recall, mine said that he had around 3,200 prostate removals successfully completed by last year).  If it means having to travel some distance to find one, so be it.  Also, try to find rating or reviews of the medical team you have been referred to, as the good ones have large numbers of positive reviews. I went through three bad urologists (including the one that performed the biopsy and gave me a horrible e.coli infection in the process) before I found the awesome one that I’m still with to this day.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a urologist/surgeon, go and have a sit-down discussion with them.  This is *important*.  When I went through my ordeal, I learned that having the surgery before the radiation is crucial... as the surgery is nearly impossible to complete successfully if the radiation is done first (too much scar tissue afterward).\n\nThe key here is that even with a biopsy, they don’t really know how far the cancer has spread until after they perform the forensic lab work afterward.  In my case, they initially thought from the biopsy that the cancer had not yet breached the prostate wall.  However, the pathology afterward revealed that the prostate wall had already been breached and cancerous cells were already beginning to spread, so I was scheduled to have the radiation treatment as soon as I was healed from the surgery — roughly a month later.\n\nThe catheter is not something that I care to go through again, but it only lasted a week.  I was told to self-remove it in the shower at the end of a week, and doing so was a piece of cake.  No issues at all other than having to sleep with a diaper on and plastic trash bags covering the mattress.  Uncomfortable, yes, but better that than dead.\n\nThe fear of PSA reoccurrence is something that you have to learn to deal with.  I have been getting checked every 3-months for the first year and mine has remained at <0.1 (undetectable).  But I won’t deny that I’m always a little apprehensive prior to the next PSA test.\n\nThere are a bunch of different radiation treatments — mine was a linear accelerator, and it appears to have done the job.  No issues with bowel movements for me, nor going to the bathroom.  In fact, throughout the entire process, I only had one “accident”, which occurred while I was sleeping and was very minor (I moved during my sleep and the catheter was swung into a position that wasn’t ideal).  Not only that, but I don’t have any issues with ED at all, and no longer have to use Viagra.\n\nI hope that this helps you.  Good luck!', '5 year survival rates are in the 90% + range for both rt/adt and rp. Recovery is much easier with rt/adt especially if you have SpaceOar beforehand.']",454

I have prostate cancer and had my prostate removed several years ago.

They had stopped doing the treatment my local doctor suggested over 5 years previously.\n\nI would urge you to seek a second opinion from one of the most respected cancer-treatment medical facilities in the US like Sloan-Kettering, MD Andersen, etc.  IMHO, the costs are basically the same except for any hotel, food and transportation costs.

The chances for a positive outcome on both issues is DIRECTLY related to the number of surgeries done yearly by your doctor.  A doctor that does 200/yr prostate surgeries generally has much better outcomes than a doctor that only does 50/yr or 10/yr.   Plus, the outcomes from using robotic surgery via a Di Vinci system generally gives much better outcomes.   So, if surgery is recommended, find a doctor that has done hundreds of them using a Di Vinci system.  Then you will get your best chance for good outcomes.', ""Your Gleason score is the sum of a primary and secondary grade. Prostate cancer is graded on a scale of 1-5, although really it's 3-5. Your biopsy showed a score of 7, which is either 3+4 or 4+3, depending on which pattern was more prevalent in the biopsy samples. \n\nA score of 7 is considered clinically significant prostate cancer, meaning that it requires some form of treatment or else it could spread. If you had a score of GS 6(3+3) you could be a candidate for active surveillance, which is basically just continual PSA tests and biopsies to look for progression. \n\nSome things to look for in your pathology report are the amount of sites that came back positive.

Of course, everyone responds to treatment differently, but my family and I have been so encouraged by the fact that there were so many options for treatment and, despite dealing with this for 10 years, there are more options available! My dad often says how much he\'s enjoyed his life in the past 10 years despite having prostate cancer -- he\'s able to do just about everything he wants to do, live a normal life and be pain-free. He\'ll be turning 80 this year, so it\'s all the more impressive to me.\n\nI don\'t know what\'s going to help you and your family, but I do know what helped me. I did research: I learned about the disease. Cancer is often seen as one disease but the type of cancer vs others may as well be as different as you can imagine. They all behave very differently, so it\'s important to understand the specific type of disease first, rather than just refer to it as just ""cancer."" Understanding the disease, treatment options, how the person will react to treatments and what other factors exist all helped to educate me, all to try to get ahead of this disease and feel more in control. For me and my friends who are dealing with this with their families, it\'s the fear & panic which handicaps the most -- education reduces the fear & panic and I feel more in control.\n\nThat being said, prostate cancer and disease in general sucks. It sucks watching your parents get older. And overall, it sucks to feel helpless. But I can tell you that, as I got educated about it, and accompanied my dad to his appointments, talked to his doctors, learned more and more, it sucked less. My dad and I also built in a reward system for every appointment: a coffee and a snack at some luxury coffeehouse (i.e. Starbucks) -- my dad would never, ever do this alone because he considers it wasteful, but loves the fact that we enjoy the small things together. I don\'t know how old you are, but I\'m in my 40s now, and if you\'re lucky, you realize that life is really all about the small things.

How could we rectify this? One measure that we can look into is PSA Density. It is a better indicator which takes your size of the prostate into account when considering elevated PSA.

Since PSA levels directly correlate to the size of the prostate, there should a linear relationship between them. In other words, PSA should only rise as the size of the prostate increases.

That is when PSA Density comes in, which equals to PSA/Size of the prostate. Generally, the cutoff of the PSA Density is 0.15. If your PSA Density is over or equal to 0.15, it means that your PSA is not increasing accordingly. A prostate biopsy is recommended. If it is lower than 0.15, you might not need a prostate biopsy if every other factors are normal.",2016-06-26 08:04:37+00:00,['Before my biopsy I had a multiparametric 3T MRI performed which identified a highly suspicious region that was then biopsied in a targeted procedure (fusion biopsy) as opposed to the conventional random biopsy procedure.

501,44 Year Old with Prostate Cancer,6,472lqn,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/472lqn/44_year_old_with_prostate_cancer/,11,"I'm a reasonably healthy 44-year old man in Canada.  No family history of prostate cancer.  While getting bloodwork done for other reasons in July 2015, my doctor suggested a PSA test for no reason other than ""why not?"".  PSA tests are not normally covered in Canada unless you have a history of prostate cancer or are over 50, simply because prostate cancer under 50 is so rare. It was $50, so I figured ""why not?"".  Turns out it was the best $50 I ever spent.

My PSA test score came back with a 5.31.  Normal PSA results should be under 4.  A follow-up test came back with a 6.2, so a biopsy was scheduled. Wasn't concerned yet, because I read that positive PSA tests in men under 50 almost invariably was a false alarm. A digital (rectal) exam also came up empty (ha ha). Had the biopsy done in early December, and got back my results on New Years Eve.  Out of the 12 biopsy samples taken, 4 came back negative, 4 showed adenocarcinoma (the most common type of cancer) on left side with a scoring of 4+3 (moderately aggressive), and 4 on the right side with a scoring of 3+4 (less aggressive).  This calculates out to a Gleason score of 7, which is relatively concerning, but not ""AAAAAAH"" terrible.  Gleason 7 is one of the most common scores men get, but its more significant considering my age, since the younger you are, the more aggressive prostate cancer can be. 

Every doctor I talked to said the same thing: ""Your prostate has got to go"".  If I were older, then there are lots of alternatives, including watching/waiting, radiation, drugs and all sorts of things.  But those are often given to men who don't have a lot of runway left in their life, and will likely die WITH prostate cancer, rather than FROM prostate cancer.  Since I'm much younger than the average (Yay me!), the best thing to do is to get rid of the prostate. 

I'm scheduled for surgery on April 22nd, 2016 at a hospital that uses the DaVinci robot, which will give me the best chances for maintaining some semblance of a sexlife and control over my bladder.  Funny enough, my pre-op appointment is on April 1st, at which point I imagine the doctor will tell me I'm the victim of an elaborate prank.

I'm taking this whole thing in stride.  Its not the end of the world, just a prostate-sized bump in the road.  Maybe the whole ""I have the big C"" thing hasn't really sunk in....who knows.  I have a supporting wife and 4-year old boy, family, friends and neighbours.  I actually consider myself incredibly lucky, because there was NO REASON for me to get a PSA test in the first place.  Had I waited until 50, my doctor would probably be having a very different conversation with me. 

While I wait for things to happen, I've been thinking about how things will change in my life:

1. My porn career as ""Johnny Bigwad"" will be coming to an end

2. No more ""facials"" or ""pearl necklaces""

3. Post-fap cleanup will be a breeze


I'll post a few more updates as things go on. Cheers!

**UPDATE (2016-May-07):**

Its been two weeks now since my surgery.  After a few hours of pre-op preparation, I was wheeled into surgery around 8:15am.  The Davinci robot was quite big and resembled a car factory robot, except with 5 arms. Surgery took about 2.5h and I was in recovery around 10:30am. Took me a while to fully regain consciousness, and I experienced only mild initial discomfort. It went very well, from what the surgeon could tell me.  Everything looked good, and a visual inspection of the surrounding tissue showed no obvious signs of cancer spread. He said he was able to spare all the nerves, and everything felt pretty much the same ""downstairs"".  I had my first walk around 6pm and a few other walks that evening.  There was absolutely no discomfort, other than what you would expect with a catheter tube coming out of my pee hole. Every time I looked down there, it would make me shudder (and still does, just by thinking about it). 

I was discharged around 1pm the next day. On my wife's orders, I took the week off and spent most of it catching up with all the movies I've been meaning to watch. Felt no pain at all, and would have been more active, but the damn pee bag was no fun at all. The catheter came out on May 3rd, which was a huge relief. Watching them take it out reminded me of someone pulling the engine start cord on a lawnmower. 

I'm now wearing a diaper, which looks EXACTLY like the diaper my kid wears to bed, except bigger and with less cute pictures on them (well, none at all). The first few days, I went through 4 or more in a day, but the past few days I'm down to 1 or 2. Working my Kegels like a madman, cuz wearing a diaper sucks. 

It will still be a little while until the report comes back with a final prognosis. I'll post the results then.


&nbsp;


**UPDATE (2016-June-08):**

Its now been 7 weeks since surgery.  Had my 6-week checkup and all was fine. My test results all came back fine.  Cancer was limited to the prostate itself and there was no cancer found anywhere outside.  I've got my first PSA test in another month.  I guess that will be the gold standard.

I'm working on my Kegels to regain bladder control. At first, I was going through multiple diapers in a day.  Now, I'm at one diaper during the day, and another at night.  The nighttime one is pretty near dry every morning, so I'm considering eliminating that one pretty soon.  The more active I am during the day, the fuller the diaper at the end of the day, but even that has noticeably improved over the past few weeks.  One thing I'm learning to avoid is alcohol.  Went to a party last weekend, and had a few too many drinks.  I found that I couldn't stop urine flow, no matter how hard I tried. Filled a diaper pretty quick, and it persisted to the next day. So, no more alcohol for a while for me.

I've been pretty successful at ""pulling the goalie"" even though my junk is as floppy as a noodle. Still able to orgasm, and they've been pretty intense (in a good way), which I attribute to the Kegel exercises I've been doing.  Just got a prescription for Viagra, so we'll see if that can make things ""look up"".

 
&nbsp;


**UPDATE (2016-June-14):**

Decided to roll the dice last night and slept without a diaper since they've been pretty much dry for a week or more now. Wife threatened to divorce me if I pissed the bed. Woke up to a dry bed and no divorce papers. I even had a wee bit of an erection during the night sometime. So, things are definitely looking up (*heh heh*).  However, my young son pissed his bed in a big way, so he took one for the team. Thanks buddy.

Results came back as Left Base - Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3+4=7, 16mm,  59% of tissue, Gleason 4 accounts for 10% of tissue.  All 5 remaining sites were benign glands and stroma.  I think this is a Grade 2 cancer?

This is where things start to get a little lost in translation.  

They were given 3 options.  1) Wait and see - check in/repeat biopsy every 6 months. 2) Surgery 3) Radiation.  She said that with my dad's condition (advanced age + genetic coronary artery disease - he's very thin, exercises daily, never smoked, doesn't drink, and is generally considered in good health despite everything) the doctor thought option 1 was what he'd advise based on quality of life.

Am I understanding correctly that for a 3+4=7 Gleason Score, the wait-and-see approach is only really an option because they are assuming his life expectancy regardless of cancer treatments would be <10 years?

I know it’s a bit early to be talking about Christmas. My apologies. I just want to have a good amount of time for planning. 

I would love to do a giveaway and charity donation at the end of the year. Here’s my thought behind it:

-	Once set up, a link to donate would be pinned at top of sub until end of year. 
-	$1 minimum with no maximum. 
-	At the end of the year, combine this sub’s amount raised with /r/menshealth’s amount raised and donate both amounts to a men’s health related charity (or depending on amounts raised, two nice sized amounts to two charities.)
-	A small portion will go back to a member of the community in form of a random giveaway. That amount onviously depends on the total raised. But shooting for $100+. 
-	Proof will be shown of full amount donated to picked charity. 

It would be incredible to start making this a tradition. With a sub this size, if only half of you donated $1, it would be a wonderful amount to give back. It would also be fantastic to get men’s health related companies to possibly donate or match, too.

If the Gleason grade comes back at 7 or higher then treatment is recommended. \n\nOnce the lab report is back the next decision is: active surveillance (waiting), robotic removal of the prostate, or radiation (usually for older men).

I noticed my PSA was increasing slightly over the past few years. Nothing major, but the Doctor was watching it and when it creeped to 4.4, requested that I go and get it checked. No history of prostate cancer in the family at all.  


I saw a specialist who found nothing during the physical examination, but suggested I get an MRI just to be certain. Turns out it was lucky that I did, because the results are not very positive. I am booked in for a biopsy in two weeks, but have so many questions before it that I didn't ask the specialist. I wasn't expecting anything to be found, so I think I went into shock when I got told it didn't look good and I couldn't regather my thoughts. 

&#x200B;

My MRI results are below, but it would be great to get some preliminary feedback on what peoples views are and what other things I should be asking my specialist before the biopsy. Seeing a PI-RADS 5 is honestly that scary.

&#x200B;

**PROSTATE SIZE.**

Estimated prostate size = 51 cc. (PSA density = 0.09 ng/ml.)

There are no suspicious findings within the anterior fibromuscular stroma.

Abnormality No. 1 located at the mid gland to gland base, right transition zone extending into the

right anterior transition zone at the gland base, 22 x 15 x 22 mm homogenous T2 hypointensity

with markedly restricted diffusion. Suspicious of intermediate/high-grade neoplasia.

Score T2W: 5

Score DCE: Non-diagnostic

Score DWI: 5, minimal ADC value = 624

This fits best with: Intermediate/high-grade neoplasia and a PI-RADS 5 lesion. 

EPE: Negative.

**LYMPH NODES AND BONES.**

There are no suspicious pelvic lymph nodes or focal bony lesions within the imaged volume.

All of this is scary, it sucks to find out you have cancer but at least they can find these things early and you can live a long life. Happy to say I'm cancer free. In your case see what the biopsy results are first, hopefully it turns out to be nothing or at the worst a non aggressive cancer that they can watch for years and not have to treat. That's what they call active surveillance. Don't know where you are but my docs and team were from baltimore and johns hopkins. Good people there.

So I had my biopsy, which wasn't as big a deal as I thought, and did have cancer. Then I had my prostate out, another not really huge deal. I'd obviously rather not have had to deal with this, yet if you're going to have cancer, this one is pretty easy to deal with, or was for me.

PSA has low specificity, meaning it could be several things one of which is cancer.

However  even these cannot definitively say you do or don’t have cancer. As was also stated in this thread, even a negative biopsy isn’t foolproof.', ""Is your PSA the only symptom?  The biopsy will take 10-12 tissue samples from different areas of your prostate.  Then they will send out the samples to a lab to determine if cancer cells are present.  They will also determine whether the cancer is aggressive or not by the shapes of the cancer cells.  Get that done and let us know the results.  Clues for me were decreased ejaculated and moderate pain.  Mine was advanced into the seminal vessels which created that symptom.  What was your PSA a year ago?

A suspect area was revealed by the MRI. Now came the biopsy.  My biopsy was an ultrasound guided one. They had the MRI picture on a large monitor and overlayed the ultrasound images over that.  This allowed them to get good, valid samples of the suspect area and surrounding tissue.

Family and friends are fans and think that's the place to go for cancer issues.  I'd agree once diagnosed.  Right now my urologist wants to do a biopsy at the local hospital.  (Well rated doctor and hospital.)  **Should I switch to MSK now or only if I get a cancer diagnosis?**

Back story:

My GP recommended a urology group because my PSA was high.  The urologist did a digital exam and ordered an MRI.  My prostate is apparently 4.5 times the typical size for my age (91g, 57years).

There is something inside (""the size of a chickpea"", while the prostate is the size of a ""large peach"") that the radiologist ranks as a 2 on some 1-5 scale which the urologist translates to 30% chance of cancer.  The urologist thinks it's a 3 (50% cancer), based on family history.

Also, if it's not cancer and I need other prostate/urology help, does a cancer center like MSK help with that?

2 generations of my family have died of PCa, so I'm not interested in 'active surveillance'. My best semi-local options are robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) and  Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), but I'm having trouble deciding which way to go. 

The long term quality of life studies I've read seem to favour IMRT, but I'm told if it doesn't work out there's no treatment other than ADT and waiting for the inevitable end, whereas if the RALP is unsuccessful I could still have radiation therapy and reasonably hope for a full cure, so I'm not sure which way to go.

Apart from the cancer, I'm in good physical shape and would like to keep working for a good few years yet (I run scientific data acquisition and processing systems on an ice breaker working in the Antarctic), so minimising the long term side effects is almost as important to me as a cure.

images were obtained. Axial fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2-weighted images

were obtained. Axial Diffusion-weighted images were obtained with varying b

values and ADC map. Axial fast 3-dimensional gradient recalled T1-weighted

restricted diffusion in the peripheral zone, or abnormal peripheral enhancement.

There is heterogeneous central gland with prominent decreased signal suggesting

surgical change with susceptibility artifact. No suspicious mass is identified.

His PSA was > 100 initially and has reduced to 0.38 over these 3 months. Since Degarelix has been taken monthly, the testosterone levels are also <7.

Scans came back ""clean"". I wrote this earlier, but I have this fear that I ejaculated too soon and too many times after my biopsy (was trying to live normally, heh) and somehow that triggered some activity in the prostate.

Prostate cancer usually moves to the bones, hips and spine.  Larger lesions will show up on ct-cat scans.  Lesions in tissues will feel hard.  So a digital exam (fingers) can identify some of the cancer if it's moved to other organs.  X-rays are used to check if it's moved to the lungs.  You definitely want your pelvis checked at some point.\n\nIf the cancer has spread to bones or other organs, most likely they will begin anti-androgen therapy and radiation.  The urologist can do the anti-androgen.  But a radiologist is needed for developing a radiation plan.

Since then we've survived the Texas Blizzard of '21, plus gotten an MRI and bone scan which (YIPPEE!) showed no spread beyond the prostate.  I continue to set the internet on fire with all my googling, and feel I have a good grasp on almost all of the treatment options we should be considering.  All except one.

Time to study up on the ultrasound procedures.  My husband's urologist is not a huge fan, primarily because it hasn't been around long enough to have a proven track record.  He does, however, have another guy in his practice who specializes in HIFU, and we have an appointment with him on Tuesday.  Evidently he was in previously in practice in Mexico, where it was approved long before getting FDA approval in the US.  Among all our options this is probably my favorite as it seems the least invasive with the fewest side effects.  My husband is only 56, so...plenty of life left.

I had a TURP done a few months before the HIFU to reduce the prostate size to fit the parameters of the machine. My doctor used a Sonablate (there is a difference between devices). I had a foley catheter after the TURP. \nHIFU procedure went well. I had a suprapubic catheter after the procedure. It is used to allow normal urination after post-surgical swelling goes down and any tissue particles have been cleared. This catheter stays in about 10-14 days, depending when normal urination returns.\nI had no leakage (incontinence) issues and sexual function returned to about 90-95% pre-HIFU (it almost never returns to 100% from where you started, AND never gets better), PSA dropped to 0.7. I was happy with the decision and investment. I hit the trifecta, or so I thought...\nMy cancer was rated as moderately aggressive, which is important to know upfront. There is quite a bit of my journey before the HIFU decision I am leaving out to keep this brief. I had been able to monitor the PC spread from 1 area to several quadrants. The initial thought was HIFU one half, but a full HIFU ablation was done. There is a margin that they leave untreated around the urethra to reduce/eliminate incontinence problems. Unfortunately, I had some undetected cell develop and grow in that area within 18 months of the HIFU (confirmed by MRI and PETScan). \nAt that time I was 56, facing recurring PC and looking at salvage therapy. I had a second TURP to try and remove the untreated tissue but it was unsuccessful. Not wanting to throw more money at HIFU to remove the cancer, I decided to have a RALP. The cancer was still confined and I didn't want to continue with the stress of PC.\nI am now 6 months into recovery from RALP. PSA is .014 (undetectable). I have a few tiny leaks (I wear a panty liner in the front and it handles it) as my control continues to improve. No luck with erections, but it is considered still very early. Btw...only 1 bundle was able to be spared, the other had heat damage from the HIFU. I'm a little bit shorter from the removal of the prostate and the part of urethra inside the gland (something the doctors usually don't discuss). I take injections for ED and I can have a sex life, but more structured and not really spontaneous. Hopefully my natural ability returns to where pills will work. Until then I just have to use the injections.\nI wanted you to know most of my journey to say I'm in a good place now. Cancer and stress free with clarity how to handle the challenges ahead.\nDo I recommend HIFU? Yes, if you have the money AND you have less aggressive PC. I was happy with my outcome after HIFU. \nBefore I got the RALP the surgeon said incontinence won't be a long-term issue and it will recover more quickly. He couldn't explain why, but it is something he has experienced with all his salvage HIFU procedures. The loss of length was not much because the prostate was already as small as it could be because it had already been treated.\nThere are many where HIFU worked the first and only therapy. Unfortunately, I'm not that guy. I had the money to try it and don't regret it at all, because at the end my side effects and inconvenience with the RALP was improved by HIFU. I researched and was well prepared for all this, and it still didn't make it any easier. Best of luck to you and I pray that the HIFU is successful out the gate.

I'm trying to get a private second opinion but I'm being blocked by other family members who give the following reasons:

1. Getting a second opinion from a private doctor would annoy the NHS doctors, and the NHS doctors would feel like we are criticizing the work they are doing.
2. If a private hospital requests my father's medical records, that it would be like requesting the NHS to transfer care from them to the private hospital.

Are these valid reasons not to get a second opinion?

They refuse to give me the name of the consultant that has been treating my father. I've tried to convince them that number 1 shouldn't be a problem because a patient has the right to seek a second opinion from another doctor. As far as I'm aware the NHS only provide 6 weeks of free care, then after that you have to fund the rest yourself.

I've assured them that the private hospital would not be taking any action such as requesting a transfer of care to them, they just want to look at my father's medical records under the NHS to see if anything can be done. When I bring up getting a second opinion from a private oncologist, they are even talking about using the money that was reserved for hospital/treatment costs for burial costs instead.

D’Amico, MD, PhD](https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/anthony-v-damico/), who is chief of the Division of Genitourinary Radiation Oncology and an institute physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nResearchers evaluated a total of 639 men (mean age, 65.83 years) with clinical T1–T4, N0M0 biopsy Gleason score 9–10 prostate cancer. In this cohort, 80 were consecutively treated with MaxRT between February 6, 1992 and April 26, 2013. A total of 559 men were consecutively treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection. Among the 559 men managed with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection, 88 received adjuvant EBRT (15.7%), 49 received ADT (8.8%), and 50 received both (8.9%). The median follow-up was 5.51 years among 80 men treated with MaxRT, and 4.78 years among 559 men treated with RP-containing treatments.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, 161 men died; of these deaths, 106 were from prostate cancer (65.8%). There was no significant difference in the risks of prostate cancer–specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 1.33) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.80) in men who underwent MaxRP vs those who underwent MaxRT. When comparing the two groups, the plausibility indexes for equivalence was 76.75% for the end point of the risk of prostate cancer–specific mortality, and 77.97% for the end point of the risk of all-cause mortality. Plausibility indexes for all other treatment comparisons were less than 63%.\n\nD’Amico said this study should serve as a wake-up call that clinicians should be treating patients who have a Gleason score of 9–10 and other adverse features upfront with a multi-modality approach. “Waiting for the PSA to rise is not as good as treating upfront,” D’Amico said in an interview with *Cancer Network*. “A lot of men with this cancer are going unaddressed for a long time.”\n\n[Amar U.

I've posted on here before about my dad.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer this year and had a radical prostatectomy in late July. He got his  bloodwork back and unfortunately his PSA is now 1.21 when they were hoping for zero.

Following this he has a had a scan and the cancer nurse called today to say they found it in his pelvis. She has said that there's nothing they can do, it's treatable and not curable. He might have up to 5 years.  They have told my dad to start hormone therapy.

My brother is going with him to see the Consultant tomorrow. My questions are: 1. What should we be asking the consultant 2. Do we have to just accept that there really is nothing that can be done? Is it worth getting a second opinion? (all his treatment so far has been on the UK national health service - NHS).

Hhis starting PSA was 7.5 and he had gleason 4+5. He had a scan pre-surgery and they said the cancer was contained in the prostate.

It just seems so crazy that there is nothing that can be done :( He is 65 and otherwise extremely healthy. Running half marathons before the diagnosis and even back running 4 weeks after the op....

Took him to the ER. An ultrasound showed his bladder had 1100 miligrams (or whatever the unit is) in it. There was blockage. They put in a catheter. A lot of bloody urine came out. They did a CT scan. The good news was there was no stones or mass or tumors. His diagnosis was a hematuria/urinary retention/UTI. They gave him antibiotics (cephalexen) and told us to follow up with a urologist in a few days. He was sent home with the catheter.

6 days later we saw the urologist, expecting to get the cathether out that day. Urologist tells us it wont be coming out today. Says that this happened because his prostate is ""sizable"", and if he took it out, it would just happen again. He schedule a biopsy (in 5 weeks, the soonest appointment). My father is on a medicine called jaylin in the meantime.

Some questions to verify information I was told/ascertain uncertain things

1) my father peed regularly and had no pain. How did his bladder get filled like that?
2) my father tested a 2.8 PSA last year. How did his prostate apparently get so large so fast? Is that even possible?
3) the doctor warned us that a psa test with a catheter in would be increase the PSA results. How much does it increase it by? My father got a 17.5 with his catheter 
4) how likely is it that cancer developed in a year? Is this likely to be cancer or just an enlarged prostate? I just dont understand how it went from a 2.8 to being big enough to fill up his bladder and make him piss blood in a year. He does ride his bike every morning for about 30-45 minutes, but it seems insane that would cause so much damage

Instead he should be on Flomax (Jalyn is a combination of Flomax and Avodart) for a week and then remove the catheter.

Prostate cancer can occur without rising PSA. Since your father is elderly, it’s more than likely that he harbours some prostate tumours. Depending on the grade of tumours it may or may not need to be treated since low grade tumours at his age wouldn’t be life threatening. \n\nThe reason why PSA increases with prostate cancer is because the cancer cells disrupt the blood vessel lining. The prostate normally makes PSA in large quantities for producing semen. When this lining is disrupted PSA leaks into the blood stream. \n\nSo anything that could potentially damage the prostate/the blood vessels feeding it. Could cause an increase in PSA.

If it’s not cancer. Then what else could it be? He seemed to not feel it’s enlarged. He said it feels hard. 

I’m not concerned. Feeling more inconvenienced. I just now started the process of selling my house and have to move by 10/29. I did give the realtor a heads up, this may get in the way. 

I have no idea how fast the act on these things. But, I had the PSA done late July.

I was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours,  and it took a few weeks to feel normal, because it's major surgery and there is a lot of healing that needs to take place:  incisions, bladder, urethra and various other abdominal things.  \n\nMy best advice to you is to make sure that your father has support around the house for at least a week or two.  I don't know who else is in his picture, or who lives with him, but I needed someone to help me empty the catheter bag and the bag covering the Jackson drain hole.  It was too uncomfortable to reach down or do anything that required lifting or even mild exertion (like making lunch).  The catheter really gets in the way of moving around, so help was also needed changing clothes and showering.  The support I had from my wife and 35-yr old son was absolutely amazing, and I think I healed better because I could focus on resting.  \n\nThe second and third biggies about recovery, of course, are the incontinence and the ED.  I'm 10 weeks after surgery and for the most part down to one pad per day (right after the catheter came out I was doing 2-3 Depends briefs per day).   It's annoying and they warn that progress can be slow, but it is getting better bit by bit -- we just keep our sense of humor about it.  And thank goodness with the pandemic I'm usually around the house anyway.\n\nED is the other big thing -- presumably your Dad isn't sharing much of that with you.  I'm taking Sildenifil daily and using a VED 3 or 4 times per week, but basically nothing is working yet.  This can take a year or two, if at all.  I had nerve-sparing surgery, but those nerves are traumatized and all confused and take a long time to learn what they're supposed to do again.  I am able to have dry orgasms with a soft penis, but I leak pee right afterwards.   I do think the impact on a man's psyche regarding ED is underestimated and underdiscussed.  Best thing for me is an understanding wife who is nonjudgemental and knows that I have to figure things out, with her and during some alone time.\n\nBest of luck to your family.

My incontinence was minimal (1 pad per day for several months), and a year later it is almost gone. Just a few dribbles every now and then. I don't even wear a pad now.

After radiation I have periodically felt discomfort or bloating in the right lower section of my abdomen, roughly an inch or two (5cm) right of my navel and extending as far as my groin.

Does anyone have any thoughts? Is there something I can do to help feel less bloated/crampy after eating  even a small meal?

The oncologist says this is extremely rare, but it appears that the radiotherapy may have damaged his bowel. It is something similar to Radio Proctitis but we wre waiting on an appointment with a consultant to follow up.

625,What’s the prognosis for prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bones? My dad’s in the hospital and I’m freaking out,3,hh6nig,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hh6nig/whats_the_prognosis_for_prostate_cancer_that_has/,10,"Hi y’all, apologies in advance for what will likely be a garbled and convoluted post, as I’m not really sure what I’m asking for. My dad is in his early 70’s and in January of this year he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that metastasized to his bones. It was the worst in one of his hips and he also had some in his spine and ribs. He has been doing chemo, hormone therapy and had radiation on the bad hip. He just finished his last chemo infusion a couple weeks ago and was scheduled to get a PET scan next week. 

I’m in a different state so I’ve been relying on my mom and dad to share info with me, so this is filtered through them, but the oncologist had given them the impression that things aren’t that bad and he probably has a few more years at least. The expectation was that the PET scan would show reduced cancer, he’d maybe continue oral chemo, and he’d continue to get PET scans every three months to monitor. That sounds like he’s got a couple of years at least, right? 

Well the night before last my dad woke up in extreme pain and was admitted to the hospital. They did a CT scan and thought it was probably a compression fracture in the spine. He’s been in the hospital since, partly for pain management, and partly because his creatine-something??? levels are too high which means his kidneys aren’t working properly. He’s been high as a kite and has told me the doctors have said it MIGHT NOT be a spinal compression fracture, but instead the cancer has spread to the muscle in his hip?? Also it’s not the hip that he got radiation on, it’s the other hip, where the cancer was not nearly as bad. Is this something that happens? Could the cancer have spread that fast and to his muscle? What about his kidneys—is the kidney issue a side effect of the treatment, or could it be that the cancer has now spread to his kidneys? Have any of you had or known someone who has had a spinal compression fracture or any of these issues and if so, what happened next? These are obviously all questions for the oncologist, but the situation is apparently not dire enough for the oncologist to work over the weekend which is good. I’m just wondering if this is more of a setback and he will be back home and close to normal next week, or if we need to start making travel arrangements for the rest of the family to visit (if COVID allows). 

Thanks so much in advance for any info or advice you can give.",2020-06-28 02:27:15+00:00,"['Can’t speak to all of this, but I can share a little about what one of my parents went through. Their cancer metastasized to the spine, and caused a spinal compression fracture.

There was follow-up radiation, PT, and a back brace that had to be worn for 8 weeks. PT was a bit intense after. Their cancer did spread very quickly. Doubled in size in 2 weeks. Not all cancers behave the same, every situation varies. Everyone responds differently to treatment. My parent was too ill for chemo.\n\nSo, is it possible to spread that quickly? It can, but it’s best to wait and hear what the official diagnosis is before panicking. I know that is a major challenge. I wish your dad the very best, hang in there.', ""His creatinine levels are probably elevated as a result of the chemotherapy, presumably docetaxel. This may or may not improve. Time will tell.\n\nMetastasis to the kidneys is extremely uncommon, so I doubt that's the case here.\n\nWhat is his current PSA and what was his PSA when he started treatment? That gives a general sense of how his cancer is responding. If the PSA is up, then worsening of the disease to the other hip or even local spread into the muscle is possible. Compression fracture is also possibly, and frankly more likely. Treatment for that is unlikely to be surgical. They could consider radiation to the spine. \n\nHis overall prognosis is very hard to establish here. Really it depends on whether he responded to chemotherapy or not. If he didn't then this is probably going to be quickly progressive. If he did respond then he'll go on to ADT with one of the oral antiandrogens (enzalutamide, abiraterone, etc)."", ""Hey, first off I'm so sorry you are experiencing this. I am in a very similar boat.

He just finished his 5th round of chemo, has lost all of his hair but the cancer is not growing even though his PSA levels spike and then drop. One aspect that I will convey is the importance of his diet. I strongly believe that food is medicine and whatever you put in your body can either feed your cancer or fight it. How is his diet? Is he eating a lot of fresh fruits and sulfur rich vegetables?

My mom was finally able to talk to the oncologist on Monday. \n\nSo the oncologist says that he has intense pain in his hip because the cancer has spread into that hip bone.\nApparently the cancer in his hip has somehow had an impact on the muscles around his hip bone and he tore a bunch of muscles. The kidney issue was apparently caused by the muscle tear which led to elevated levels of creatine kinase. They pumped him full of fluids to flush that out, and his levels are lower now, but the fluids gave him pneumonia, so he’s fighting that off as well. \n\nTo manage the pain from his hip, they are going to do ten rounds of radiation over the next two weeks, and depending how he responds he may have to go into a rehab facility until he can walk again. We were all afraid he would never walk again, or worse, that he was in the end stages and would die soon. So this is wonderful news. \n\nThank you again for your kind words, advice and stories.

I am wearing adult diapers (not just pads) and need to change them 4 to 5 times a day and once again during the night.  It is beginning to get me down.

I am seeing the urologist on Monday so I am not asking for any kind of diagnosis here : I would just like to know if anyone has experienced this sort of problem after a RALP : 100% non-stop day-and-night incontinence.

I will be having a prostatectomy in about 3 weeks or so.   

Everything I have read says not to do heavy exercise for 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, but everything also says that you need to walk a lot as soon as possible after the op.

As the weather has been dreadful where I live, and as simply walking around the apartment would probably drive me crazy, I was thinking of investing in one of those home treadmills.  Which leads me to two questions:

1. Has anyone done this and can report on their experience?
2. When you look up ""home treadmills"" on the internet, you are generally steered towards treadmills for serious joggers, like Nordic Track, which is obviously not something I am going to be using post-op.  I have a gym membership anyway for when I am back up and running (literally as well as figuratively) but it is too far away for me to walk to.  Does anyone have any recommendations for less sophisticated treadmills that can be used for moderate walking only?

647,(Hopefully) final update on 63-year-old who had prostate surgery in early January,2,f8zi3i,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/f8zi3i/hopefully_final_update_on_63yearold_who_had/,6,"Greetings all. I feel as though I could be the poster child for successful laparoscopic prostate surgery. You can see my other posts starting in early January leading up to and post surgery. 

I have been very fortunate and it’s gone extremely well for me. First off, they were able to remove all the cancer. I will have a PSA follow up in a month or so but it looks good. I had next to no pain and only a short time dealing with incontinence the first week. I have been doing ED therapy for a few weeks and thought I would update on that.

I went into this entire process ignorantly thinking that I would turn into a eunuch after my surgery. It’s not that I’m some big stud but I had a healthy sex life (for 63) before the surgery and assumed (wrongly) that not only would it be over but I would have no interest in sex either.

I took it as an extremely good sign when the night after the surgery the nurse leaned over to adjust something on my arm and I had the desire to grab her. Yes I guess I’m a pig! BUT I did not grab her for what it’s worth. ;)

but seriously, I took that as a good sign that I was not going to turn into an asexual being. A couple of weeks after the surgery I started therapy with a quarter Viagra each day before bed and an entire one on the seventh day where I was to engage in some sort of sexual activity. 

I would place those early erections at a 5 to 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. About four weeks after the surgery I “think” I experienced my first orgasm. It was extremely odd to be honest. For 50 years an orgasm for me meant ejaculation…and of course porn always stresses the money shot as well. It wasn’t particularly strong but it did have some characteristics of an orgasm.

The following week I felt like I achieved a seven or so on my scale of 1 to 10. I definitely had an orgasm but I spent more time thinking about how odd it was than enjoying it.

Then last week without the help of the full pill I had another eight on the erection scale and I definitely enjoyed the orgasm.

Because of our travel schedules the past few weeks these orgasms have been by myself. Yesterday my wife’s and my schedules aligned and we had “activity” together. However I started thinking too much about the erection, or lack there of, and nothing was happening. Just for some intimacy I got on top of my wife and while she was using her vibrator I orgasmed but was definitely not hard. It was the best it had been of the four attempts as I guess I wasn’t staring at nothing coming out. :-)

So in conclusion I am about eight weeks removed from the surgery and have had four orgasms with each one getting progressively better. 

Sorry for the long post and explicit details but I know it was troubling to me beforehand and I would’ve wanted to have heard the good and the bad.

I have decided not to post this anonymously as this seems to be an extremely respectable sub.

While I'm not likely to become a vegetarian I am now trying to eat better while I get ready for surgery and whatever might come afterwards."", ""I did a lot of research on nutrition and prostate cancer when I was first diagnosed.  There is very little information out there that any particular diet is better than another, and many studies  about specific foods or nutrients contradict each other. [This study may give you some idea of how complicated it all is](\\(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597758/\\)). \n\nThere are a few things that might be said with some confidence:  \n\nLycopene, which is found in tomatoes, may slow the growth of prostate cancer. However, the concentrations in raw tomatoes are low, so there's usually much more in cooked tomatoes--tomato paste, sauce, ketchup. You can also take it as a supplement.\n\nPhytanic acid, which is produced by ruminants when they eat chlorophyll, may speed the growth of prostate cancer. Interestingly, this would make grass fed less healthy than feed-fed beef and dairy for someone with prostate cancer. \n\nCholine tends to be found in high quantities in prostate cancer--so much so that it is used as a marker in PET scans looking for metastasized prostate cancer.  Choline is found in eggs, liver, dairy--so you might take this as another reason to avoid meat. However, it's also found in significant quantities in wheat germ, brussel's sprouts, broccoli, spinach and other vegetables. Choline is also necessary for producing certain neurotransmitters and may be especially important for brain health, especially as you get older.\n\nThere was one study that said chicken increased prostate cancer risk; but after more careful examination it was shown that eating the skin of chicken increased the risk, and no increase in risk was shown in eating skinless chicken.\n\nSo, there is some evidence that eating a plant-based diet may be better for preventing or slowing the growth of prostate cancer, but most of it is equivocal. \n\nBut dietary studies don't tend to tell you what will happen to any particular individual if they eat a particular diet. Someone else on this thread mentioned that they were a vegetarian for many years and still got prostate cancer.  The same is true for me. I ate no meat at all for more than ten years, then added fish to my diet for another ten years. I still got it, diagnosed at age 50.\n\nEdit--I also think another biopsy is questionable after two in five years, especially for a man of 66.

I imagine doing surgery would most affect anal sex even if nerves were spared. Can anyone speak to this? What does prostate stimulation feel like without a prostate? Is that form of  pleasure just gone, reduced to zero? 

We had one Dr recommend Cyber Knife, so we were thinking that that might be a good way to preserve more anal pleasure. Can anyone speak to that? (Also, he said surgery can in fact be done after radiation, was that not accurate?).

His PSA has been slowly rising over the past months and I think the highest was just over 5. He went for an MRI about a month ago which didn’t show anything concerning. After another elevated PSA recently he went for a biopsy and 5 of the 12 were positive. The doctor said he could either have a prostatectomy or go for radiation (1 x per week for 40 weeks). This is all very new to us and I know my dad is concerned about side effects. I’m curious for any input on which treatment option is best and also if there are specific questions we should be asking, or things to be aware of. Thank you in advance!

Edited to add- he’s a very active, healthy 70yr old and is very into outdoor active sports so quality of life/potential side effects are of a concern.",2019-11-25 19:30:44+00:00,"['I recently had surgery and am recovering. The PA told me that generally with surgery you have immediate side affects which improve over time. With radiation you are fine initially but side affects develop. Both good at five years. But I wanted it out.  Read, read, read and find a doc at a major medical center with a lot of experience.  But trust that dad will be okay.  That is most important.', ""There is really no 'best' treatment. Radical prostatectomy is generally considered the gold standard, but radiation is equally as effective for intermediate disease. The best thing you can do is gather as much information as you can about the options available to you. Be sure to speak with a surgeon and with a radiation oncologist.\n\nIn terms of disease control, surgery and radiation for intermediate localized disease are both excellent. It's worth pointing out that in case of recurrence, radiation is still an option as a salvage treatment if you have surgery, whereas once you've had radiation surgery generally cannot be performed.\n\nWith surgery you will generally know fairly quickly if the treatment was successful. Pathology can be performed quickly to determine if any cancer existed at the margins, and your PSA will become undetectable shortly after treatment. With radiation it's a bit less clear, since the entire prostate is not destroyed, tissue remains behind and continues to make PSA. Interpreting PSA levels after radiation treatment is a bit more challenging because there is normal PSA still being made by the remaining benign prostate tissue, but sometimes there can be PSA being created from cancer cells that somehow managed to survive the treatment.\n\nThe side effect profiles for surgery and radiation are similar. Generally surgery is associated with more incontinence issues and radiation is associated with more bowel issues. Both will impact erectile function. With surgery erectile dysfunction tends to be immediate and, in some men, will alleviate over time. With radiation side effects usually do not occur right after treatment but slowly develop over time.\n\nIn terms of surgery it would be good to find out if his nerves can be spared or not. With nerve sparing surgery the chances of regaining erectile function are higher. In terms of radiation, it would be good to find out if brachytherapy alone is an option. Brachy alone is less likely to cause erectile dysfunction, and I believe it's possible to have surgery if you've only had brachytherapy. \n\nThere are also other less conventional methods for treating prostate cancer, like High Frequency Ultrasound (HIFU) and proton therapy that are worth asking about. Since his cancer could not be imaged on MRI it's unlikely he would be a candidate for any focal therapy options, but you could always inquire."", 'There is another viable alternative to a 70 year old.

I think the «\xa0accepted wisdom\xa0» is that if the cancer is still consigned to the prostate itself and hasn’t spread anywhere, it is better to remove the prostate than to have radiation.

I don't know all the details but from what I can gather he is beyond being cured, but at least it's moving slowly.

So last summer, he was out in the garden and was stung by a wasp. No problem he thought, he'd never been allergic to them so it'll probably just hurt a little. Wrong. From what I was told it sounds like he went into anaphylaxis and had to be rushed to the hospital and get a shot of Epi, he stayed a bit for observation and then was released. A little while goes by and he goes in for a routine checkup for his cancer. His doctors are a little confused. His PSA was showing an improvement, which is good but unexpected.

And then summer rolls around again this year, and it's a ""wasp year"" (which is a regional, bi yearly abnormal amount of wasps). Thankfully he now has an Epi pen at home. Which quickly comes handy, because he gets stung again when sitting down in his garden chair! He injects himself with the Epi pen and it all goes relatively OK.

A little while goes by and back in again for his routine check up. The doctors are now even more flabbergasted. It's his PSA again. It has now, over a period of a little more than a year, gone down from over 60 to 2.5 ng/mL! What?? That's the level of a normal, healthy 40 year old (which he does not fit the bill for). They ask him what's been going on and tried to connect the dots. And as you probably can guess, it's ""thanks"" to the wasps!

Apparently research is being done for wasp venom as a therapy for a couple of different types of cancer, including Prostate Cancer: [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/298863.php](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/298863.php). The thing is, the article only mentions a specific wasp native to Brazil. In this case Dolichovespula norwegica is the most probable culprit, could this be significant?

I was somewhat surprised because I thought it would come back clear, just an enlarged prostrate.

NOPE :(

So now I'm scheduled for a 12 point biopsy in a couple of weeks.

My main concern is that it hasn't spread. They can take the thing completely out and I'm good with that. In fact, I'm sitting here wondering they they don't just remove it instead of biopsies first.

He said the MRI's are graded between 1 ( less than 10% chance of cancer) an 5 ( 90 - 92 %) chance of cancer and mine was a 5.

So I'm wondering what I face going forward as far as the biopsy and afterward and, most likely, removal of the prostrate in the near future.

Can someone tell me their experiences with these proceedures? How bad is the chemotherapy / radiation stuff?",2018-08-31 20:50:58+00:00,"[""If your biopsy comes back positive you will have a better idea of your risk factor and if treatment is required. Prostate cancer is graded on the gleason score system. It is assigned a primary and secondary gleason score, ranging from 3-5. \n\nIf your gleason score is 6 (3+3), depending on the volume, your age, and your PSA, you may not require treatment at all and can instead opt for what is known as active surveillance whereby you will undergo serial biopsies and PSA monitoring. However, since you have a positive MRI this is actually less likely as Gleason 6 cancer tends not to 'pop' on MRI.\n\nIf you have what is known as clinically significant cancer, gleason score of 7 or higher then you will need to consider active treatment. Likely prostatectomy(surgery) or radiation. You options here will depend greatly on if/where the cancer has spread. \n\nAfter your initial diagnosis you will undergo staging scans to determine this. Likely an abdo/pelvic CT and a bone scan.\n\nIf your cancer is localized, i.e. it has not spread outside the prostatic capsule then you will most likely need to choose between radiation and surgery, of which your doctor will go over the risks and side-effects. Most commonly, incontinence (surgery), bowel issues (radiation) and erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nOne advantage of surgery over radiation in this case is that radiation can be done as a salvage treatment if surgery fails, whereas generally surgery is not an option post-radiation.\n\nIf you have metastatic disease then you are looking at a situation where, in general, hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy will be utilized to control the growth of your cancer. Also possible as a neoadjuvant (prior to primary) treatment if you have highly aggressive disease.  \n\nThis is just a general overview of general clinical pathways. You may be a candidate for alternative treatments or clinical trials. My advice is to research as much as you can, and to always (always) get a second option on your situation."", 'I just got finished in mid-July (two months ago) with all of this.\n\nIn April 2017 my PCP noted a slightly elevated PSA of 5.0 and some swelling of my prostate when he performed a DRE.  Then to the urologist, who confirmed all of the previous findings, and put me through a regimen of heavy antibiotics in the event it was an infection (it wasn’t).  Then I had to wait many weeks for the biopsy to be scheduled and performed (November 17th), fight a nasty E.coli infection from the procedure afterward (no Thanksgiving with family), and wait an excessive amount of time for the biopsy diagnosis — which was finally delivered on December 6th — cancer... and not the slow type.  I was told that I needed to begin immediate steps to aggressively deal with it and that the completion date should be no more than 12-months later.\n\nI had previously scheduled rotator cuff surgery on December 15th, which required over a month of recovery (no Christmas or New Year’s with family).  \n\nThe second week of February was the prostate MRI, which confirmed the biopsy.  Also during that week I had a colonoscopy, which came back with a serious colon cancer scare (they found large polyps and removed them, and needed to do a follow-up exam as soon as feasible).\n\nWe met with the prostate surgeon on February 16th, and the procedure was scheduled for March 26th.\n\nAt this point I had seen my PCP, two urologists, a prostate oncologist, a medical oncologist (I didn’t know that there was a difference between the two), and a whole battery of different lab work and scans.  I had initially thought to go with radiation as the primary treatment, but was told the same as a previous commenter here, that radiation is better as a follow-up to surgery, rather than the other way around, due to scar tissue afterward.  When running this scenario past all of the team, they *all* agreed it was the best course of action for me as an individual (your mileage may vary from mine).  So I felt comfortable going forward with their recommendation of having the surgery first.  And I’m glad I did.\n\nThe biopsies from the prostate surgery came back by the second week of April, and they found that the cancer had *just* breached the prostate wall.\n\nUGH!!!  So now I needed radiation beam therapy as well.\n\nI should note here that the surgeon said that the E.coli infection that I got from the prostate biopsy created scar tissue that he had to deal with during the prostate surgery; what should have taken 2.5-hours stretched out to nearly double that due to the unexpected scar tissue.\n\nI had to recover from the prostate surgery before doing the radiation, and the surgery recovery was more draining than I expected.  Keep in mind that I was also still recovering from the shoulder surgery and the associated physical therapy that went for months after that.\n\nI had to have a follow-up colonoscopy on May 7th (whew — no colon cancer after all! Yay!), then radiation beam therapy began in the third week of May and ended in mid-July (one session each weekday, but skip weekends and holidays [plus the linear accelerator had to be repaired and that added another day], for a total of 35 sessions).  If you’ve had your prostate removed, the daily dose is equivalent to 2,000 dental X-rays per session, or 70,000 by the end of the therapy.  The biggest surprise side effect to radiation therapy?  The fatigue.  Fatigue hits you like a hammer and it’s all consuming, up to the two-week mark after the end of the daily sessions.\n\nAt the 6-week mark after completion of radiation therapy, I had my first PSA test... it came back as “< 0.1”, which is “undetectable” according to my urologist/surgeon.\n\nSo now — 18-months after my PCP raised the initial alarm — I’ve been officially declared clear of cancer, but I’ll continue to have PSA tests done at least twice per year for the next ten years.  So long as the PSA score doesn’t rise, then I’m good.  If it does rise, then I need to go through chemo.\n\nOn a brighter note, I’ve recovered beautifully.  I have no issues with bladder or bowel incontinence, and have been able to fully resume intimacy with my spouse (it’s not the same as it was prior to both surgery and radiation, but is still enjoyable for both parties).\n\nIf you have any further questions, ask away.', ""Did your doctor say that the outside of the prostate had been breached?\n\n\u200b\n\nMy advice is for you to seek out a prostate support group in your area.

My dad was just diagnosed this week with advanced prostate cancer. They have just done the diagnosis based on a PSA test. This is his third battle with this type of cancer, and it’s related to agent orange and his time in Vietnam. He is being treated by the VA. They’re not sure if it’s spread to his bones, etc yet. They believe this to be the case because he’s had the surgery to remove the prostate, it came back, he has had the radiation treatments and his PSA went from a 5 to a .3 and it’s climbing back to a .5 now. They believe that it is still in the prostate area but it’s too small to see is what they’re saying. They would like to do hormonal therapy next to slow the progression, and I understand this is the text book process. I guess I’m looking for answers, how does this continue to occur when the recidivism rates are low for this type of issue (comparatively), what are the treatment options here, and what could we be doing to stop this cancer?",2018-08-18 22:54:59+00:00,"['This occurs when the cancer cells have left the prostate capsule and invaded the regional tissue, lymph nodes, and/or bones. \n\nHormone therapy is standard of care in his situation.

If they can pinpoint the location of regional recurrence he may be able to have targeted radiation.

The doctors told her said has to heal from his surgery before they can do anything, and possibly start radiation in May (which seems like a long time?). So...realistically, what are his chances of surviving this?  They don’t seem good. I just want to be prepared to help them (especially my mom) through this. Thanks",2018-02-16 15:22:43+00:00,"['There are three important numbers you need to know in order to realistically assess his prognosis.  His age, his pre-surgery PSA, and his post-operative Gleason score.  With those numbers there are programs like this one [(https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/post_op] that will give you a general idea of how long it will take for the disease to progress.  If you\'d like me to run those numbers I can send you the result, but it\'s all pretty straightforward.  Just remember that if the numbers are bad, that doesn\'t necessarily mean your step-father is doomed--just as if they are good it doesn\'t necessarily mean he\'s out of the woods.  They are statistics that tell us what the likelihood of certain outcomes are in a given population.  They cannot predict any particular outcome.\n\nAlso remember if you run the nomogram, it will not take into account any further treatment your stepfather will be getting.  So whatever the ""15 year"" survival rate says, that\'s what it would be if he got no further treatment.\n\nThe realities are these: 1) prostate cancer generally grows very slowly, and 2) once it\'s metastasized, there is no cure.  But even without a ""cure"" there are treatments that can extend life for some patients for a very long time (I know of men with metastasized PC who are still alive 20 years after diagnosis).  That being said, some patients don\'t respond as well to treatment and don\'t live as long.\n\nIt is not clear to me though, that your stepdads cancer has ""metastasized"" as yet.  Lymph node involvement isn\'t great, nor is the cancer spreading into his pelvic floor.  But, it is possible that, if the cancer is contained there, the radiation may be very effective for him.  If they find distant metastases, the prognosis gets worse.  \n\nAs for waiting to do radiation, it is necessary because he needs to heal from the surgery.  But there is no reason they cannot begin doing imaging tests to see if they can detect any distant metastases, most likely in his bones.  If that is the case, then prostate bed radiation may not be helpful.

I was wondering if it's really a good idea to stop hormone-sensitive tumor cells from growing while doing a chemo. My father is currently having a anti-androgene-therapy and will do a chemo in a few weeks. So I did some research and there came an idea to my head: 
What if you give patients with heavily metastasising prostate cancer testosterone, so that every cell with a hormone receptor intensively starts growing. Then the chemo would destroy those rapidly proliferating cells, instead of ""just"" killing those with hormone immunity. I know that other, healthy cells with hormon-receptors would also be destroyed, but I think that's a fair price for getting rid of tumors. (And wouldn't it also be better for the rest of the body because there are more fast growing cells which ""absorb"" those cytostatics? Of course you would have to adjust the amount of chemo-medicaments, so I'm not quite sure about the last point.)

732,Father recently diagnosed,3,7am9qe,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/7am9qe/father_recently_diagnosed/,12,"Hello /r/ProstateCancer 
My father confided in me today that he was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, although they are unsure the stage/spread of the cancer.

He had last visited an MD in 2008, and had no regular checkups between 2008 and 2017- until very recently.  He had gone to the doctor for a regular check up and had some bloodwork done and his 'levels' were at 10.5 which I guess is high?  The doc did a biopsy and it tested positive on Wednesday.

He is going in for an MRI next week and I'm just kind of wondering what to expect- he said he feels like he is in good health, never felt better.  I am sort of in shock of the whole thing.  My father is 68 years old.  My mother is a breast cancer survivor, I went through that when I was about 11-12 and again when she had a second diagnosis, and I was about 20-21.  The first time I think it took a while to process the severity of the issue, I might possibly lose my mother?  But the second time I was inconsolable.

I think I came on here just to vent or something, I don't really know.

Anyone else in a similar situation?",2017-11-03 20:54:49+00:00,"[""The 10.5 probably refers to his PSA, which stands for prostate specific antigen, which is released by the prostate.  The number can be high for several reasons, one of which is cancer.  10.5 is pretty high, but the number can get into the hundreds or even thousands with metastasized prostate cancer.  So 10.5 isn't great, but its not nearly as bad as it could be.\n\nEarly stage prostate cancer usually has no symptoms, so it is not strange at all that he feels fine.  The good news is that probably means his cancer is still in the early stages.  \n\nA biopsy will tell you more than simply whether or not you have cancer.  It may be that your father isn't clear on the information he got or he is not sharing that information with you for his own reasons.  \n\nWhen they biopsy prostate cancer the pathologist gives it a score, called a Gleason score, which is between 6 and 10.  This score gives some indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer.  Gleason 6 is the least aggressive, and may require no treatment at all.  Gleason 10 is very aggressive.  \n\nA biopsy may also tell you how much of the prostate is cancerous.  Usually they do 10 to 12 needles (called cores).  The more positive cores, the more likely it is that the cancer is larger; the larger the cancer, the more likely the doctors will want to treat it aggressively.\n\nAn MRI can also tell them how much cancer is in the prostate.  It may also be able to tell them whether the cancer has grown outside of the prostate and whether it is in nearby lymph nodes. This information can help your father decide what treatment, if any, is best.  If the cancer is very indolent, he may not need to do anything other than keep an eye on it.  If it is more aggressive but contained in the prostate, then surgery or radiation are the standard treatments.  If it has grown outside the prostate, then usually radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are used.  If it has metastasized, meaning its now growing in areas farther away from the prostate--usually the bones--then ADT is usually the first line treatment.\n\nIt is important to recognize that prostate cancer in a 68 year old man is not that unusual.  Also, most prostate cancers are not super aggressive, and can often be cured completely or treated and managed for many years.  I know men who have been living with the disease for 20 years or more.  So it is by no means a death sentence for your father.  \n\nGood luck to you both.\n"", 'I am 73 years old and have untreated prostate cancer since 2010.  /u/cranky_old_fuck has given you good information. The only thing I can add is that the biopsy is not painful. It might be a bit uncomfortable and he could be a bit sore the day after but not bad.  ', 'I think you\'ve got enough info to make you worried but not enough to give you an informed view.\n\nI was diagnosed 3 years ago and I\'m doing ""active surveillance"" for the time being.  This means nothing is happening so I\'m being monitored to make sure it doesn\'t suddenly get worse before any treatment is given.\n\nFWIW I had a delayed appointment once with a specialist who was dealing with a guy with a PSA of 1000+\n\nMRI scanning is getting extremely sophisticated and may soon replace the need for biopsies.  I\'ve had two ""template biopsies"" where they take up to 40 cores via 12"" long needles (don\'t ask, fortunately general anaesthetic) and some genetic testing, so they have a very good handle on what\'s required and appropriate.\n\nOver the coming weeks he\'ll have various tests to ascertain what, if any, treatment is required.  The one thing I would say is that you should be aware of the treatment alternatives because a surgeon will always recommend surgery and a radiotherapist will always recommend that.\n\nThere are new options around too like high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and proton beam radio therapy.  Surgery nowadays is usually done robotically with much less damage to nerves (and therefore less incontinence and erectile dysfunction)\n\nProstate cancer in a lot of men goes undetected and they often say you die *with* it, not *from* it.  Better to know (IMO) and make an informed decision.\n\nLast thing, don\'t know what shape your Dad is in but search YouTube for Kegel exercises.  A stronger pelvic floor will help him anyway but it will be a huge benefit if he needs any treatment because it will help with incontinence/ED.

733,Why isn't high grade incurable prostate cancer treated aggressively?,3,785lyv,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/785lyv/why_isnt_high_grade_incurable_prostate_cancer/,5,"Many people have low grade prostate cancer which won't significantly impact them during their lifetime, and I understand how aggressively treating that is not appropriate. Some people have more aggressive prostate cancer, and that needs to be treated. If it is considered curable the main choices seem to be prostatectomy and radiation therapy.  But if it's not considered curable, a different set of treatments is used, which seems questionable to me.

I think reducing tumour size more ought to help survival:

* Each cancer cell which can reproduce has a chance to develop a mutation which increases its resistance to therapy. If there are more such cells, there are more chances to develop resistance at a given time. With less cancer cells, resistance should on average take longer to develop.

* Having more cancer cells probably means more chance for new metastases

* Shrinking cancer more sets back its growth more. 

Androgen deprivation therapy is nice in that it works for most patients, the side effects are less than with chemo, and there's no major operation with risks and possible complications. But, the cancer tends to develop resistance. So, why not start off with something more to fight it?

After eliminating as much cancer as possible at the prostate and detectable metastases via radiation and/or surgery, androgen deprivation therapy would only have to deal with probably much fewer remaining cells. Chemo could shrink that even further. I'm thinking this ought to give a chance at longer survival and longer symptom free time.


So, it seems weird to start off with only androgen deprivation therapy instead of attacking the cancer with multiple therapies to shrink it even more.

I've found some articles which seem to support these ideas.
 [This](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/a-potential-cure-for-metastatic-prostate-cancer-treatment-combination-shows-early-promise) hints that such an aggressive treatment using surgery and/or radiation can help. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26222275) found benefit with combination of chemo and hormone therapy.  [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066882/) shows that radical prostatectomy may help patients with metastatic prostate cancer. ",2017-10-23 05:14:35+00:00,"[""I think (as a PCa patient who has done a fair bit of research) you make a couple of questionable assumptions here.  First is that more aggressive treatment is never done with metastasized PCa.  It is my understanding (and I know a number of men who have gone through it) that radiation is often combined with ADT.   I believe the thinking is that the side effects of prostatectomy at that point tend to outweigh any benefit it might impart, but I have heard of cases where it has been done. \n\nI think ADT-only is usually reserved for much older patients and patients with very late stage PCa. In those cases the idea is to prolong life and reduce symptoms, which may, particularly for the very old, be all that is necessary. Aggressive treatments have serious side-effects, so I think it is often a question of balancing of interests--let's say surgery could extend your life six months.  Is it worth the pain, recovery and side-effects?  Maybe not.  Radiation also has side-effects and is often used to help shrink bone mets to help with the extreme pain bone mets can cause.  It is likely that also blasting the prostate bed with radiation will increase radiation side effects and make the patient sicker, so it may be kinder to reserve the radiation for palliative care.  Longer life is not always the most important consideration."", 'Aggressiveness of therapy depends on the type of prostate cancer and the general health of the patient. There is a recent trend to be more aggressive earlier - for example mHSPC should now be treated with both ADT plus docetaxel, there are significant overall survival benefits. The benefits and problems with salvage surgery and radiotherapy are being published on more and more.\n\nBecause the drugs are what induce the mutations (or rather the drugs set up a clone selection environment), there is good reason to use them sequentially in terminal disease rather than as a cocktail, like in AIDs), to slow down the creation of mutations that make the cancer more aggressive. So for androgen axis therapies, use ADT alone and wait for the tumor to make its own androgen, then switch to enzalutamide or abiraterone. Resistance will build to those driven by splice variants of AR, or even neuroendocrine prostate cancer - treatment induced NEPC is really bad, the longer you can hold that off by delaying treatment with enza or abi the better.\n\nThat has been the conventional thinking as far as I know. There are quite a few studies for the newer drugs like abi and enza and now apalutamide (for nmCRPC, not yet approved) to be used earlier in disease. While there should be short term benefits, I am not sure if there benefits to overall survival have been proven (anyone please correct me if I am wrong).\n']",734

I was diagnosed with prostate CA in 2009. Had radical prostatectomy same year, PSA score continues to clock in at 0.1. - this is great news, as I am considered cured.
I am among the 50% of RP patients that end up with permanent erectile disfunction. After waiting and hoping for improvement, the doctor told me that I was not going to get back my ability for even a partial erection. I finally decided to have the penile implant surgery about a year ago. The full recovery takes several months, but it improves steadily. I'm now in ""working order"" once again.
The problem: When I'm with my wonderful wife and the situation is turning into one of those lame Cialis TV ads, I leak urine, and it's a pretty fair amount at that. There is a term for it; it's called climacturia.
This happens not only when we're in the middle of sex: If I merely walk up to her in the kitchen and start hugging and feelin' frisky, I leak. Making out in the car after a nice night out for dinner ? The flood gates open.
During everyday life, I'm 99% dry. Just during foreplay and sex with the wife. That's ""the trigger"".
I had read that a bladder sling helps guys who have incontinence, and asked my urologist/ surgeon to install one while I was having the implant surgery, in order to help with the problem. This had made zero difference in the leaking. He says that I should just live with it.
My wife tries to be a great sport, but I know that she is pretty turned off about this situation. I don't blame her. It also kills any ""ED commercial-type spontaneity"", as we have to plan specific places to do the deed, so as not to ruin the bed, carpets, couch...you get the idea.
Here's the strange thing: When I'm ""going it alone"", I can achieve orgasm in a reasonable amount of time. (You RP patients know that there is orgasm but no ejaculation). But there is almost never any leaking. It's only when we start fooling around together, and it worsens as things get more intense.
I hate this. It's messy, a mood killer, uncomfortable, and at least for me, sort of gross. So, I'm looking for any advice. Can I control or ""unlearn"" this reaction? Anyone else have any experience?
Thanks in advance.",2016-12-13 16:18:03+00:00,"[""I would ask if you have considered wearing a condom. Preferably a tight one. I know it is uncomfortable , but you won't leak inside her.

I just had the catheter out yesterday. \nWould dehydrating yourself before intimacy aid in urine production and leakage?  What about the prescription used for bladder xo trip?

A week ago I [asked you for your thoughts on what you want from this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/4z5ddt/rprostatecancer_subscribers_what_do_you_want_to/). Thank you for those that either directly replied or upvoted to give their opinions.
  
&nbsp;
  
This sub is all about you guys and also keeping up to date with everything happening in the development of treatments available so your opinion counts.
  
&nbsp;
  
Reddit is all about community, therefore I think it's a good idea everyone starts to talk to each other to share your experiences and support each other. On here it's been difficult to present to you guys a good way to do that. From this I've got a few suggestions for you all to vote on for what you want. I suggest we start with bi-weekly threads and depending on popularity we can either increase or decrease this time and add in new topics if you want to be more specific.
  
&nbsp;
  
The poll is below, it will take maybe 5 seconds to click an option whether on web or mobile.
  
&nbsp;
  
I'll let the vote run from today **29th August** until **12th September** so there's a good two weeks to chose your option. From there I'll reveal the most popular bi-weekly thread and set that up on a schedule. I'll make sure any new bi-weekly threads are announcements to make them easily seen. As always feedback is always welcome on this sub of anything you want to see or make happen as a subscriber. This will hopefully be one of the first ways in achieving that.
  
&nbsp;  
  
Anyway here is the poll below, please vote on there not on here. I've kept it to 3 options which I think covers most areas as a starting point (we can get more specific as time goes on if we need to!)
  
Thanks :)

770,Help me work up the courage to deal with it,3,403enn,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/403enn/help_me_work_up_the_courage_to_deal_with_it/,4,"Was diagnosed with stage one cancer four years ago. Been on active surveillance since 2012, but last week something changed. My PSA is still stable at 5, but things feel different ""down there"". I know a lot of nerves grow around the prostate and I fear that some growth (or something) may be impinging on a nerve. I fear that my days of avoiding surgery may be coming to an end.

So here’s my problem - I’m absolutely terrified! I’m terrified of dying, of being in pain, of losing control of my urination, of being impotent, of - not being a man - everything! My rational brain knows the *right* thing to do, but I’m overwhelmed by my fear and dread.

Have any of you overcome this? Any advise?",2016-01-08 22:17:35+00:00,"[""So what is different that makes you so concerned?  I was stage IV when I was first diagnosed - generally too late for surgery.  You are correct that the nerve bundle does pass through the prostate, so swelling of the prostate can cause problems.  In my case, it was a sudden inability to urinate that sent me to the doctor for what I thought was a bladder infection.\n\nI am now looking at surgery to remove the prostate, as chemotherapy and hormone therapy have not resolved the growth of the cancer in my prostate.  I can certainly understand your apprehensions about the potential damage to the nerve bundle and resulting incontinence and/or impotence problems.  In my case, I am especially concerned because I sometimes feel this is unfair to my wife, who is significantly younger than me, so I feel she is being deprived by my medical issues.  However, I am told there are medical procedures that can help with both of these issues, and I also realize that if I do not eliminate the cancer in my body, then I will almost certainly be leaving my wife alone much sooner than I had ever imagined.\n\nIt's a tough road and requires a lot of contemplation on what is important in life.  Make sure you discuss your concerns with your urologist and oncologist (if you are seeing one).  Never hesitate to get a second opinion (I have two different oncologists at two separate hospitals, so I get a variety of opinions on what is the best course of action.)\n\nMost importantly, remember that you are not alone in this."", 'First off, I should say that I can only speak for myself but I hope you can take some comfort.  I\'m on active surveillance too - for nearly two years.\n\nOne of the problems of active surveillance is that guys start to get anxious and ultimately ""doing something"" is better than ""doing nothing"".  I\'ve got some sympathy with that, and certainly my partner would like to ""whip it out"" straight away instead of losing me.\n\nLet\'s look at the options.  I know you\'re terrified of incontinence and impotence but there are solutions to all those things.  Some of them are permanent solutions and some of them are a temporary lift (so to speak) Personally, I would rather put up with any amount of difficulty and know that I was alive.\n\nDon\'t be one of those guys who ignores symptoms.  It\'s probably nothing but, get it checked out.  I suspect a simple MRI scan will be all it takes.\n\nWhy have you jumped straight to the idea of surgery?  Even in the 4 years since you have been diagnosed there have been tremendous advances in treatment.  I don\'t know where you are or how old you are but there are lots of alternatives... if you even need treatment.  If you\'re not happy about surgery, especially if they don\'t do robotic surgery, ask for a referral.\n\nHere in the UK there are hormone treatments, radiotherapy, brachytherapy (including chaining seeds together to target them more effectively)  and others. You may even have proton-beam radiotherapy in your country (UK is building two centres opening in 2017 I think)   It might be that you\'re not suitable for some of these but there are lots of alternatives and your Consultant could advise.  Be aware that surgeons always recommend surgery and radiotherapists always recommend radiotherapy!! :)\n\nSo, currently you don\'t know if you have anything to be anxious about.  The only way to resolve this is to get it checked.  Then make an informed decision about your treatment options.  The earlier you make that step, the closer you are to an all-clear or some treatment.  I\'ll bet, if you joined a support group, you\'d find lots of men with the same concerns.

Some of you close to me know that my dad Jerry was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer earlier this year.  And while many cases of diagnosis call for regular monitoring of the disease, often for years, this was not an option in my fathers case.  Despite this he has caught it early and is has a very positive attitude towards it. After months of hormone treatment, he will finally start radiotherapy sessions next week and hopefully begin on his road to beating this disease and full recovery.   


Although prostate cancer occurs mainly in older men, with about 6 cases in 10 diagnosed in men aged 65 or older, it can strike in men as young as 40!  In the UK alone;

**Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.*

**Over 42,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year – that's more than 110 men every day.*

**Every hour one man dies from prostate cancer – that's more than 10,500 men every year.*

**1 in 8 men will get prostate cancer in their lifetime.*

**Over 330,000 men are living with and after prostate cancer*


Every year many of us blokes (and some courageous ladies!) don as much facial hair as we can during the month of November in order to take part in the growing craze that has become known as Movember. But for many it is a cultural fad with little meaning behind the actions. I want to change that and make sure everybody understands what **Movemeber** really means, how it has grown (literally) year on year from country to country and has now reached wide world recognition.

773,Eunuch after RALP,2,qpet29,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/qpet29/eunuch_after_ralp/,3,"Hi there.  Apologies to those who have read previous rants on the subject.

I am the only person I am aware of who has this particular problem.  After my RALP (about a year and a half ago), I have lost all sexual sensitivity ""below the waist"".  

A lot of people posting on this sub have mention erectile dysfunction following a RALP, but they usually point out that they are still able to reach orgasm, albeit they remain flaccid.  Typically they then ask about what can be done to achieve a proper erection, which elicits answers ranging from bi- or tri-mix to use of penis pumps, etc.

My case is different : not only can I not achieve erection, but attempts at masturbation produce absolutely no effect, no desire, no sensation of sexual pleasure at all.  The use of my penis is effectively limited to urination.

My urologist is stumped.  He informed me not only that my RALP was nerve-sparing, but that in any case the tissue that is removed during a prostatectomy only affects erection, and that the nerves that produce sexual pleasure are located elsewhere in the body and are unaffected by the prostatectomy (hence the ability to obtain an orgasm even without erection in most men, even post-RALP).

Needless to say, I am extremely upset by all this - I really do feel as if I have become a eunuch.  Now, naturally, I am really happy that the RALP appears to have ""beat"" the cancer (all PSA tests since the RALP result in indiscernible levels, less than 0.01), but losing any sex drive at all was a price I did not think I would have to pay.

Have any of you experienced (or know someone who has experienced) this issue, and if so, have you heard of any treatment effective for it?  So far I have tried Viagra, Cialis and penis pumps to no avail.

My dad (60) just told me he might have prostate cancer. I am not in the medical field at all and am trying to make sense of it all. How much is him over-worrying? How much is him minimizing? He's a doctor and so I don't know what to make of it. I can't tell if he's being proactive and cautious with telling everyone, or if he's minimizing and painting a rosy picture. I just can't get a read on him

Here's what I know

* PSA 7
* Gleason 9
* quickly developed and he calls it ""aggressive.""
* Says it ""may not be operable""

He just told me today. I am emotionally all over. I teared up, turned to rage, felt scared, and left exhausted and confused. I just don't know what is going on. I want to protect him because I love him so much but I feel so powerless.

So can someone please break this down for me? Every youtube video feels like an infomercial. I can't make sense of the scientific literature. What can I do? What does the future look like? Honestly, I wish this were a bear because at least I could fight that.

I feel... I guess I just feel desperate. What does his future look like?",2021-10-29 23:16:23+00:00,"['The other commenter said, correctly, that many people die ""with"" prostate cancer and not ""from"" prostate cancer.  Just to clarify, that means that they die (at whatever age) from some other cause and not from the prostate cancer\n\nPSA of 7 is mildly, only moderately, above normal.  Gleason 9 is fairly high.  Those two values seem contradictory to me.  You might ask your dad\'s urologist about that.  For comparison, my PSA has been about 7.5 and Gleason 3+4=7 without changing much over the last two years. \n\nIf you\'re looking for further information and studies, check out the websites of any major medical center. Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and UCSF (San Francisco) are some that have good prostate cancer teams and websites with detailed information aimed at helping patients. And the [Prostate Cancer Research Institute, near LA,](https://pcri.org/) has a helpful website and a [lot of informative YouTube videos] (https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePCRI) that don\'t feel like infomercials.

Took me a few weeks to accept the news. We will all die one day, whether it be cancer or something else. \n\nAnyways, due to it being metastatic, the urologist refused to operate. We got second opinions from oncologists and they agreed with the urologist. The way they described was even though it’s not curable at his stage, it is still treatable. There are a variety of drugs out there that can manage this disease. My father’s current treatment plan is taking a hormone shot every 3 months (Eligard), Xtandi pills daily, and will hopefully start radiation soon. \n\nMy suggestion is just be there for your father and spend as much time as possible with him. This will be something you and your family will learn to deal with. There are many treatments out there that can help your father manage this disease. I suggest you see the best oncologist that specializes in prostate cancer in your area and have them come up with a game plan (If your father hasn’t already done this or is planning to).

I am looking for resources on behalf of my Dad who is 78. Dx with prostate cancer 3 years ago, initial Gleason score of 6. He was actively monitored until his Gleason suddenly rose to 10 a bit over a year ago, at which point they decided to treat. He had a TURP last October 2020 to alleviate swelling/blockage, followed by a 5 week course of radiation in Jan/Feb 2021. He has also done two Lupron shots since radiation, but will have no more.

Long story short, he is still bleeding when he urinates with clots and tissue passing, especially after activity (walking or playing with grandkids). He is still almost completely incontinent, especially during activity. He is also experiencing extreme fatigue and depression. As he conveys it, his doctor is unconcerned and won’t investigate. I live far away so I’m trying to help him script his doctor’s visits so he can communicate better and so we can understand why these complications remain and how to improve them.

My questions are:

1) Is this normal and should we be concerned?

2) What are the best resources online that will help me understand this?

3) How important are lifestyle factors to healing? My Dad’s diet is poor and my mother will not help him. If need be, I’d like to have him move into my home for a while to help him manage his lifestyle, but wonder if that make a meaningful difference. He’d much prefer to be at home.

791,Would appreciate some input on my father's PC prognosis.,2,pqu453,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/pqu453/would_appreciate_some_input_on_my_fathers_pc/,5," EDIT: For some ridiculous reason the formatting for this sub literally capitalized every damn word I wrote.  Not me, I'm not a psychopath, sorry if it makes it difficult to read. 

Context--

(I apologize in advance for not having the PSA numerical data to hand, if someone is a clinical specialist and wants to interpret it more closely I could probably obtain it from my father or his charts by tomorrow)

My father is currently 67, and was age 60 at diagnosis.  The intial flag was from his PCP via digital exam, and he was then referred for imaging studies and a PSA test.  These revealed a large mass that was, fortunately, still confined to the prostate, but was large and similar in character and aggressiveness to typical prostate cancer malignancies.  A biopsy was performed, and, in fact, the mass was a malignant tumor, which was graded with a Gleason score of 3+3 based on the pathologist's report on the biopsy sample.  

Given my father's relatively young age at diagnosis, he and his doctors decided to take a relatively aggressive approach in dealing with it.  The fact that both his father, and his father's father had both perished of prostate cancer metastases also played a part in this:  He and his doctors were of the opinion that there could be a genetic component that might contribute to the cancer's aggressiveness, later shown to be prudent when a genetic study performed a few years afterwards showed him to be possessing a mutation on/positive/a carrier for (not sure of the terminology) the BRCA2 mutation that is linked to earlier-onset and clinically significant PC and other cancers.  

At this point (Summer 2014-ish), the decision was made to perform the following to push the cancer into remission:

* Radical prostatectomy

* 6 months of pelvic radiation therapy

* 1 year of hormone suppression

The hormone suppression was started immediately upon diagnosis, and the surgery was scheduled and performed swiftly.  The surgeon also performed extensive dissection of local lymph nodes, and no spread was noted in the post-surgery report.  The tumor was upgraded to a Gleason score of 3+4 versus the biopsy sample's 3+3 score, a fact which the oncologist stated was most likely due to the limited nature of the biopsy relative to the holistic analysis possible given the removal of the entire organ in the surgical setting.

After the radiation therapy and prostatectomy, his PSA zeroed out (undetectable), which we all thought was awesome, and he was relieved to be able to get off the Lupron.  

Everything was fine until Summer of 2018, when his PSA became detectable again, at which point his oncologist adopted a ""wait-and-see"" strategy to see how fast the PSA increased, and no action was taken.  By Summer of 2019, it became apparent that the recurrence was serious, and a PSMA-PET imaging study was performed to search for possible metastases.  Two <1cm areas of ""hypermetabolic activity"" (This is what the imaging report said: I assume this refers to the relatively fast-growing and resource-hungry nature of cancerous tissues, which would be ""hypermetabolic,"" or utilizing glucose/ATP/oxygen/whatever more quickly relative to normal body tissues, but I wasn't positive.  Input would be greatly appreciated.)  were discovered in the study, one in the major fissure of his right lung tissue, and the other in a lymph node in his thoracic cavity, behind the lung (the doctors did not think the two nodules were related, despite their colocality, because one was literally inside the lung and the other wasn't).

Hormone suppression was resumed (I think he actually started Lupron slightly before the imaging was done, but perhaps not early enough such that it had a visible effect on the tumors and their visibility on those imaging results), and he began a regimen of Docetaxel and Abiraterone, which lasted from the fall of 2019, and was supposed to finish out in early Summer 2020, but as we all know, COVID-19 made 2020 a bit of a year, and he and his doctors no longer felt it to be safe for him to make the trip into NYC to receive treatment, so the regimen was swapped in February of 2020 to a take-home prescription of Xtandi capsules, which he took for several months, and then finished that course of take-home chemotherapy in (roughly) June or July of 2020.

At this point in time (July 2020), his PSA was undetectable, and another PSMA-PET study was performed, which showed that the two nodules/problematic areas had disappeared/were no longer visible.  He remains on hormone suppression to this day (mid-September 2021), and his latest PSA test (August 2021) is still undetectable.

My question is as follows:

* Given my father's medical history, what is his prognosis as of today, given the information I've provided above?  

Of course, there is a wealth of literature out there, which I've pored over for many hours, that give a fairly consistent 5-year survival rate of about 30% for cases of biochemically recurrent PC.  This seems like a fairly doom and gloom sort of a figure, albeit not the 99% of (god forbid) glioblastoma multiforme or something like it, but a really worrying statistic nonetheless.  Given that he has undetectable PSA at this point + has responded very well to the treatments he's received thus far, how does that modify (if it does at all) that survival chance?  

What are his chances, honestly?  I'm super grateful that the radiolabeled/PSMA-tagged treatment regimen is coming to market in the US, and I'm excited that we have yet another weapon, but even that only adds depressingly few months to that survival timer.  Just really looking for some opinions, if this is the wrong place, place point me in the right direction.

There are too many factors to consider so it\'s best to forget the 5 year rate which is based on older data and a mostly older population that doesn\'t fit his profile. \n\nYour father has responded well to treatments, he\'s younger than most, and sounds pretty healthy otherwise. . He is maintaining undetectable PSA on just the lupron. Which means that if it flares up, he can still use abiraterone or xtandi. He isn\'t resistant to the docetaxel and that remains an option. Plus beyond the lu-177 there are many other treatments in the pipeline.  So there are a number of different options IF It flares up.\n\nI\'ve been having these types of conversations with my doctors for over 9 years now.  Two things have been important. 1.

Keeping an understanding of what are the tools left that haven\'t been ""used up"".

Eventually I did get very low risk prostate cancer, but so did my half brother who was not into exercise at all. The family link is much more important than the diet in my opinion. Your sons dietary and exercise habits indicate that he is aware of and an active participant in his own health - a good thing. That being said, ""bulking up"" isn\'t really a healthy pursuit and he would be healthier if he was into cardio rather than muscle building. When I was young I was into weight lifting but, switched to running and lost a lot of weight and some body fat. Most urologists don\'t seem to be concerned with diet at all.

When all is said and done, the only thing that I have truly lost is the ability to ejaculate.  \n\nThe idea of using radiation to kill my prostate and then leaving it there to slowly dissolve just creeped me out and still does.', 'There are a lot of good choices now, which those before us didn’t have. \n\nSome things that don’t vary with choices \n\n- lose weight if you need to\n- get some cardio going- you need stamina \n- kagles, kagles, kagles \n- get your lady talking with you - she needs to talk it out and needs to go to the doctor visits to hear for herself \n\nRadiation usually requires a course of doses that lasts a long time and requires you to show up over and over. If you live close to the treatment location that might not matter but for some that is a serious problem. \n\nGood surgery requires a hospital with excellent robotics and a surgeon who has done a large number of the procedures. Someone who has done it a hundred times may not have “seen it all” yet. Access to a great surgeon and top robotics might tip the scales. \n\nThe “odds” quoted are not super useful. The data looks back over a few years, while all treatments are improving. It makes it hard to compare the options, and doctors are often not the best at statistical analysis.

The odds quoted are averages. They lump new green surgeons with super pros together in quoting how long you will recover.

If you do radiation and need follow up, most surgery is no longer an option and, the surgery options which remain are more brutal than RALP. \n\nSo, for me RALP was a choice I feel good about, but as they say, your mileage may vary. \n\nMy case is pretty positive because I had great support from my wife, church and doctor.

Mark Sholz’s book “The Key to Prostate Cancer” discussed this in Chapter 23.  It appealed to me because I hoped that keeping cancer at bay for some period of years might permit development of a better cancer treatment in the interim (e.g., a cancer vaccine, or some other option with no side effects).  One benefit that Sholz cites for hormone therapy is that its side effects are temporary.  However I’m not at all sure this is true based on other reading I’ve done.\n\nThen I read Dr. Patrick Walsh’s book “Surviving Prostate Cancer”.  On page 204 he addresses Sholz’s line of thinking:  “The idea here is that these men can “buy some time” until a new cure comes along that has few or no side effects. This is a false promise. What these [doctors] fail to tell patients is that these drugs will do nothing to slow down the growth of prostate cancer cells that are not controlled by hormones (these are called hormone-insensitive cells; See chapter 12), and in prostate cancer, these are the ones that can ultimately kill you.“\n\nLater I spoke to a local radiation oncologist who is the department head at his hospital.  I asked him about hormone therapy as a “buy some time” treatment, and he strongly advised against it.  In fact after an hour consultation, his parting words to me were, “Don’t do the hormone therapy”.\n\nI ended up having a robotic-assist prostatectomy in late May of this year.  I did a lot of research on surgeons.  My surgeon had performed 200 open prostatectomies and over 500 robotic-assist prostatectomies.  Following surgery I regained my continence almost immediately after my catheter was removed.  Erectile function has remained mostly ‘dormant’ but am starting to see some signs of life.  I’m 54 years old and even before surgery my erectile function had diminished somewhat so I didn’t expect a perfect result after surgery.\n\nBoth the Sholz book and the Walsh book I cited above were very valuable to me in my decision making.  Sholz is a medical oncologist in Southern California who specializes in prostate cancer.  His book contains chapters contributed by 30 different prostate cancer experts and does a nice job of explaining the pros and cons of different treatment options for different grades/states of the disease.\n\nPatrick Walsh is a famous surgeon at Johns Hopkins who pioneered the modern nerve-sparing form of the prostatectomy.\n\nMy surgery in May turned up some additional microscopic cancer in the neck of my bladder.  My surgeon recommended adjuvant radiation therapy and hormone therapy to try to mop this up.  That’s one advantage of prostatectomy as primary treatment.  If it doesn’t get all the cancer you have the option of doing radiation afterward to clean up the cancer that was missed.  However if you do radiation as primary treatment then a subsequent prostatectomy to clean up recurrent cancer is extremely risky.  The radiation makes the treated tissues adhere to each other and thus makes surgery very difficult.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck to you both.', 'Hormone therapy more or less keeps the PC from advancing (from my understanding). Radiation and RALP are considered definitive treats (again my understanding). \n\nAt 48, I’ve just completed 45 IMRT+IGRT treatments. I had a couple weeks mid-radiation where it was difficult to maintain an erection, but that was also around the same time I got my second Lupron shot. Now that I’m a few days pst the end of my radiation, things appear to be returning to my pre-radiation normal. \n\nThe ADT does lower libido, but for me it didn’t remove it completely. \n\nRead carefully, there are a lot of potential side effects from all treatments that some will never see. \n\nFor me, the ADT and the accompanying mood swings and hot flashes have been more difficult to manage than anything about the radiation. \n\nGood luck to your S/O.', 'To me the HT is by far the worst.

My dad is stage 4a, no sign of cancer in his bones, but cancer has spread outside the prostate.

He's currently going to Texas Oncology and doing lupron shots.  TO also performed radiation.  It's been 3 years now and his PSA is very low, like 0.25, 0.5, etc and holding steady.

That said, i know hormone therapy is not a long term solution, and anticipate at some point he'll need to look at advanced treatment options.  I always assumed at that point we'd head to MD Anderson.

However, reading another thread posted here in the last 24 hours, I'm second guessing that and wondering if it would be better to get started with MD Anderson sooner rather than later?

I guess i just assumed the initial playbook for prostate cancer is the same, so rather than driving 3h each way to Houston once a quarter, he could get his treatment locally and have a local oncologist monitor PSA.

However, if there's something MD Anderson provides or something else in his care that would make sense, even given his great response to hormone therapy, maybe we should consider that?

823,Dad about to start radiation,2,o8ak0n,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/o8ak0n/dad_about_to_start_radiation/,4,"Hi. I’m new to Reddit, so please bear with me!

My dad (65) was diagnosed with prostate cancer in late 2020 (PSA level at 28, graded group 2, Gleason 3+4). He had a full prostatectomy shortly thereafter. At his first or second follow-up visit several weeks later, they found that his PSA had started to rise again (went from 0.3 to 0.49 quickly). Additional CT scans found two “areas of interest” — one on the floor of the prostate cavity, and the other near (but not on or in) his bladder. He started hormones and will begin radiation next week. He’ll go 5x per week for 8 weeks. He plans to drive himself to and from radiation each day, about 45 minutes each way, which I think is silly and unsustainable. (I’ve offered him a place to stay since I’m much closer to the hospital, as well as transportation - so I hope he takes it eventually.)

So I guess my questions are: (1) How concerned should we be? Nobody has used the words “aggressive” or “metastasized” outright, but based on all the Googling I’ve done (for better or for worse) and the speed at which his PSA started rising after surgery, I get the impression that this is in fact aggressive. Still not sure whether it’s technically considered metastasized, though. (2) What should we expect for radiation side effects? Again I’ve googled, but my dad is the first really close/immediate family person to go through this, so I would appreciate any real-world side effects to watch for. And (3) How can we best help him through this? Were there things you’ve done for people going through this, or something someone did for you that you really appreciated?

Basically this is entirely new to us so I would really appreciate any insight, anecdotes, advice, wisdom, etc. that you have to offer.

That is, I don't think he'll fall asleep at the wheel. The diarrhea set in at two weeks. It was mostly under control using Imodium, but there were some . . . surprises. That could make a long car drive unpleasant. The nausea kicked in during the final two weeks, and it was the worst part for me. I didn't even want to ride in a car, much less drive one. Your bladder should be as full as possible when getting radiation. I imagine that the process of drinking lots of fluid--but not peeing--will be happening during your dad's long drive. That could be a drag, too. All in all, his long drive is probably do-able, but could get uncomfortable , unpredictable, and boring as his treatment period progresses. He could likely do it.

My dad got diagnosed with prostate cancer at the end of 2019 (stage 1-2).  
Last night, he told me that he’s considering Nanoknife treatment at Vitus Prostate Center.

I have a few questions:

\- Has any of you tried Nanoknife? If so, did it help you?  
\- Does anybody know about Vitus Prostate Center? Is it legit? Can you recommend other places?  
\- Is Nanoknife safe?

I dont expect you to answer all of my questions, I’ll be more than happy to talk to any of you who knows about the procedure :) I just want to make sure that the treatment is safe/worth the money.

Thanks in advance!

Pathology showed 1 area with positive margins in adipose tissue but no cancer in lymph nodes that were tested. My first post-surgical uPSA at 3 months came back at 0.11. Urologist says that's not great, but we will continue to monitor and he will advise when he feels like we need to discuss salvage treatment. I kept an appointment with Radiation Oncologist (RO) at 3 months post-surgery, that was set up when I went for pre-surgery consult. RO said that he had a ""sense"" that we should plan to begin radiation therapy (RT) and scheduled another 3 month follow-up.

6 month uPSA came back at .089 and Urologist says it's encouraging and we will check again in 3 months and hopefully it continues to go down. I canceled the appointment with RO because, hopefully, the PSA continues to dissipate. The RO called me and basically said that I should still plan on RA because I was high risk and relapse will almost certainly occur at some point and generally came across as pretty negative about relapse and pushy about me getting RT going.

Urologist has been fantastic through all of this and has encouraged and referred me for other treatment options but the RO has been pretty certain from the first time I consulted that I will need RT even after the RP which has come across as a bit of a ""money-grab"" in my mind.

From what I've read in a study using uPSA of 0.2 as a cutoff, there seems to be about 50/50 chance that I will need RT in the future. I'm thinking I would prefer to wait and see if the PSA continues to go down but perfectly willing to look at RT if/when it starts to go back up. I also don't want to make a stubborn decision just because the RO annoys me.

Just got home from a urology appointment for my grandpa 85 years old. stage 1 prostate cancer, bone scan showed NO metastasis. PSA 14, don’t know the Gleason score

Moreover, I know that this problem pales in light of actually having cancer.  But here goes again.

About a year ago, I had a RALP following deep vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, which caused the doctors to suspect PC, followed by the usual round of PSA tests, MRI, etc. and finally a biopsy which showed that I did indeed have it.  The surgery worked : PSA has consistently tested as indiscernible since then.

However, and despite assurances by the urologist that the RALP was nerve-sparing, I have NO sexual sensitivity at all in my penis.  I am NOT talking simply or erectile dysfunction (I could live with that, I guess), but no ability whatsoever to have an orgasm or even provoke any sexual feeling at all with my penis.  I still have libido - I still want to touch, kiss, etc, but below the waist - nothing.

I have tried Viagra and Cialis - nothing.  I have tried Vitaros locally - nothing.

They want to give him bicalutamide and he is unsure if he wants to take it. He would like my advice and I've been tying to dig through research online and help him out. 

From what I'm reading, antiandrogens like bicalutamide are typically used for advanced stage prostate cancers which have metastasized and spread to lymph nodes/bones/organs outside of the prostate. It seems like the latest thinking on prostate cancer in older men which hasn't spread is that your likelihood of dying from something else is fairly high, so it's becoming more common to simply monitor it and make lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of spreading. I'm concerned about the potential negative effects of antiandrogens like depression, and some of the other effects of low testosterone like increased risk of dementia, fatigue, muscle loss, etc. 

Generally my inclination if it were me would be to take extreme diet/lifestyle measures to stop or slow the spread and monitor it closely, going on to things like antiandrogen treatment if it gets worse. I've read a lot of great things about sulforaphane for example and its ability to slow the growth of cancer, one study showed 86% decrease in the doubling of PSA. I know that his diet isn't great so he could stand to eat an high quality paleo diet, exercise more, etc. Considering the slow growth of prostate cancer, wouldn't it be wise to attempt a natural approach first and see if the PSA reading goes down? Or would it be good to do that in addition to the bicalutamide, and if it ruins his quality of life, discontinue it?

I feel like I may get responses to trust the doctors, and I can respect that but for one thing we don't live in a large city with cutting-edge specialists, and I have good reason to believe that outdated approaches like pre-mature medical interventions or drugs which impact important hormonal function could very well cause far more harm than good in some people.

This will give us a good indication as to what's going on in his prostate. His prostate volume will give us the ability to calculate a PSA density, which is just the PSA divided by his prostate volume. Usually anything greater than or equal to 0.2 is a cause for concern.\n\nAs far as diet is concerned, it's really more important to keep track of your diet early on as opposed to trying to make lifestyle changes once you've already been diagnosed. I believe there is some research out there which demonstrates that dietary changes don't necessarily impact the cancer, but in some cases actually allow the man to live longer because it reduces their incidence of heart disease and other diseases commonly associated with the western diet. Look up any videos by Mark moyad on YouTube.

But after looking at all the pros/cons for it and for other treatments, I ultimately chose **proton therapy**, which is a form of external beam therapy, and I would encourage you to investigate it, understand it, and consider it, too. I am guessing that when you say ""external radiation"" you are referring to conventional x-ray/pHoton radiation, and you are not including pRoton as a distinct form of EBT, but it is radically different and deserves a careful look.\n\nIn a nutshell, conventional radiation (x-ray/photon) radiates a lot of healthy tissue on the way to/from the tumor site, including everything in the path of the beam, coming and going. IMRT does its best to mitigate this, but can\'t eliminate it. In contrast, proton therapy has relatively low involvement of healthy tissue. Proton has lower intensity upon entry (i.e., at the skin), drops most of its load at the tumor site (google: Bragg Peak), and then has no measurable radiation beyond that. \n\nProton is not without risk,but with less healthy tissue experiencing radiation, it stands to reason that the likelihood of side effects or of future secondary cancers will be lower.

I finally broke down after trying to seek professional help (only to be told by Doctor's in their field that their method was best) and by my own doctor that whichever method I choose he would support (except prostectomy at this time)  . . . So . . . here I am seeking advice on reddit (but, hey, it's as good a place as any . . . right??)

I've probably had prostate cancer since 2016.  My first PSA test in the spring of 2017 showed a  PSA of 3.7 and I didn't think anything of it.  My primary recommended I see a urologist but I put it off until my PSA got around 4.5 and then I had a biopsy in November 2019 confirming prostate cancer.  I don't know all of the numbers, but my core count was low enough to do ""watchful waiting"" . . . subsequent examinations and PSA tests fluctuated but remained relatively 4.5-6 . . .

In December my PSA rose to 8.2?? and I now have more cores with cancer . . . still my urologist says that he would support: watchful waiting, brachytherapy, or EBRT . . .  

My primary doctor recommended ""Eat To Live"" by Joel Furman.  I started cutting back on carbs and eating one of those bag salad kits for lunch along with a half a cup of almonds to stave off hunger 6 days a week for about a month.  My most recent PSA test this week was 6.5 and my urologist again says that he would support: watchful waiting, brachytherapy, or EBRT . . .

I can't seem to get any advice  . . . my wife wants me to do ""something"" . . . but I like the idea of ""watchful waiting"" but I am slightly scared that the cancer may metastasis.

From what I read the prostate's main function involves reproduction with some added benefit to urinary control (but is not necessary for urinary control) . . . even though I'm only in my mid-50's my sex life is virtually null . . . I am leaning toward brachytherapy when the ""time comes"" but my understanding is that there is a certain window for brachytherapy . . . my point is: I really don't care much about sex . . .

My current plan (as of today) is that I am trying to focus on healthy eating and my overall health.  In 6 months I go in for an ""examination"" and another PSA test . . . if my PSA stays low and the doctor ""feels"" nothing unusual I suppose I will keep watching and waiting . . . my next biopsy would be in June 2022.

I honestly don't think about it at all except when it comes time for a biopsy . . . because it's then that my body ""feels"" it and has to deal with the recovery of the biopsy . . . and I get stressed out to the point of anger and tears.

Recall the physicians\' creed *primum non nocere* \\-- ""first, do no harm"".  This would not be standard of care, and would put a physician\'s license in jeopardy.\n\nProstate cancer is quite common, but it only occasionally kills people . . . most folks with prostate cancer die with it, not of it. Prostatectomy is a \\_less\\_ burdensome procedure than it once was-- but its still no walk in the park. You need only look at an earlier posting [""Prostatectomy regret](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/kloywx/prostatectomy_regret/)**""** to get a sense of the price that patients do pay -- I had a relatively easy time of it, but there were complications and there\'s no way I\'d have run those risks had I had a 3+3 pattern. Even when stuff all goes smoothly, it\'s got its risks.\n\nToday you\'ll find leading oncologists crunching the numbers to see just which patients with prostate cancer will and won\'t receive enough net benefit from the surgery to make it worthwhile.  Leading oncologists are now suggesting that even some Gleason 3+4 patients with small cancers should wait, that the burden of intervention outweighs potential benefit for some of these patients, who previously always were referred to treatment. Also note that with Prostate Specific Antigen, urologists are in the unique position of having a very good diagnostic-- a high risk patient can have frequent PSA tests, perhaps starting as early as age 40 . . . this will almost certainly catch any developing cancer very early; no other common cancer has a diagnostic that\'s this reliable.\n\nYour question suggests a parallel with prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy-- but here\'s the thing: a woman with BRCA mutations may be at extremely high risk of a lethal cancer, early in life. This is knowable, and once this cancer is found, it may in fact already be metastatic -- both ovarian and breast cancers are much nastier beasts than Prostate Ca, and there\'s nothing nearly so good as the PSA test.  And while a mastectomy is no fun either, with reconstruction at time of surgery, it\'s a less traumatic surgery than a prostatectomy. While prostate cancer does have some genetic associations, there\'s nothing like the ultra-high-risk category that the BRCA women have.\n\nSo, no, the idea makes no sense. While somewhere there\'s a surgeon who\'ll do anything for money, I suppose, this would be very wrong. Occasionally there are men with severely hypertrophied prostates that are not cancerous, but which are so large and frequently infected that a prostatectomy is warranted. . . . but a man with a normally functioning prostate, normal PSA, he has no cause for a prostatectomy, and no ethical physician should suggest it, absent some extraordinary circumstance.', 'No, I’ve had both a prostatectomy and radiation at 44 after being diagnosed. There’s no way I’d ever recommend surgery as preventive. There are so many better ( and cheaper ) methods to diagnose - the awkward digital rectal exam, the PSA Test, CAT Scans, MRIs, and the new PSMA Scan. Recovering from surgery is brutal and requires you to exercise Kegel muscles daily to maintain continence. The problem is that the scans - and even PSA aren’t performed early enough. I wasn’t scheduled till 50 and even after it came back extremely elevated, my doctor prescribed antibiotics thinking it was due to an inflammation.', 'Absolutely not.

890,Dad diagnosed with stage 4,2,k6i9bc,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/k6i9bc/dad_diagnosed_with_stage_4/,19,"Hello all, 

This is my first post here. My diabetic dad (age 65) was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer on Monday (11/30). He has a Gleason score of 8 and his PSA was about 78. He had a bone scan which revealed he had a 1.7cm sclerotic lesion at the sacrum. He hasn't had any real symptoms other than arthritic pains, but the key indicator was seeing blood in his urine at two separate occurrences. 

\---

Long story short (kind of),

My dad has Kaiser HMO and has been with the same PCP for the last 10 years.

In 2010, my dad had his first prostate exam with a PSA of 1.6, his dad had prostate cancer but it was caught in the early stages and he addressed this  concern to the PCP.

He had not been asked to take another prostate screening in the next 10 years. I'm not sure if this is something that Kaiser reminds its patients to have, but the PCP had told my dad his PSA was a good number so he didn't think anything of it after.

In 2017, he revealed to his PCP at checkup that there was blood in his urine. PCP performed rectal exam and diagnosed him with benign prostatic hyperplasia and put him on Terazosin. No additional tests were performed. 

At the start of October this year, my dad noticed blood in his urine again. He was treated for a UTI, and after his antibiotics were complete, more blood appeared in his urine and more tests were ordered. There appeared to be blood in his urine that was not visible to the human eye. PSA level test was ordered and he is at stage 4 now. We read the diagnosis from an automatic release online and we were only told that now he needs to see an oncologist and that there was no rush for it.

\---

I am not sure if it is Kaiser + Covid, but the urologist has told us nothing detailed about what to expect or what our nexts steps should be. My dad is very uncertain about his prognosis and is very uneasy. We have no resources for what we should do for our dad so any links to online resources would be very helpful.

Can someone please provide any insight as to what we should expect? We are taking him to City of Hope at the recommendation of family members since we were really unhappy with Kaiser's treatment of him.

""The Clinical Findings Show That Early Urinary Continence Is Possible And The Novel Hood Technique Helped To Speed Up This Process,"" Dr. Ashutosh (Ash) Tewari Of The Icahn School Of Medicine At Mount Sinai In New York City Told Reuters Health By Email. ""Ninety-Five Percent Of Patients Were Able To Achieve Urinary Continence Within Days To A Week Rather Than Waiting Weeks Using The More Standard Techniques.""

""Hundreds Of Thousands Of Patients Have Undergone One Or Another Transperitoneal Anterior Radical Prostatectomy Technique, So Most Surgeons Are Already Familiar With This Approach,"" He Said. ""The Hood Technique Was A Minimalistic Change In An Already Existing And Familiar Approach For Many Surgeons.""

Following Prostate Removal, The New Technique Preserves Tissues That Together Have The Appearance Of A Hood - Namely, ""The Detrusor Apron, Arcus Tendineus, Puboprostatic Ligament, Anterior Vessels, And Some Fibers Of The Detrusor Muscle,"" Dr. Tewari Explained. The Strategy ""Spared Musculofascial Structures Anterior To The Urethral Sphincter Complex, With Early Return Of Continence After Surgery Without Compromising Positive Surgical Margin Rates.""

As Reported In European Urology, The Researchers Studied Outcomes Of 300 Patients (Median Age, 64) Treated By Dr. Tewari Using The Robotic-Assisted Prostatectomy (RARP) Hood Technique Between 2018-2019. Fifty-One Percent Had Stage T1 Cancer; 35%, T2; And 14%, T3.

Catheter Removal Was Performed On Postoperative Day Seven. The Continence Rate - Defined As Completely Pad Free - At One, Two, Four, Six, 12, 24, And 48 Weeks After Catheter Removal Were 21%, 36%, 83%, 88%, 91%, 94%, And 95%, Respectively.

Fourteen Patients (5%) Were Not Continent At The End Of 12-Months Follow-Up: Nine Were Using An Occasional One Pad Per Day (PPD); Three Were Using Two PPDs; And One Was Using Four PPDs.

The Overall Positive Surgical Margin Rate Was 6%.

Thirty Patients (9.7%) Experienced Complications After RARP: 17 (5.7%) Had Clavien-Dindo Grade I Complications; 11 (3.6%), Grade II; And One (0.4%), Grade III.

Despite The Technique's Success, ""Guidelines Should Not Be Changed As Comparative Trials Are Still Needed,"" Dr. Tewari Said. ""This Is Not The Only Technical Refinement Happening In This Field. There Are And Will Be Many Other Approaches And Techniques That Will Impact The Guidelines We Need To Tailor The Surgery Towards The Patient, Rather Than Applying One Surgery To Every Patient.""

My PSA numbers have stayed low, going from the initial 4.35 to 6.24 during the past ten years.\n\nRecently, at my request, I had a fusion biopsy (one that is guided by the results of a previous MRI) and the result was that the cancer had remained small but the Gleason number in part of the cancer had been upgraded to Gleason 7 4+3. \n\n4+3 Gleason is considered to have more potential for aggressive growth than Gleason 6 or Gleason 7 3+4. Since I am 76 years old, I decided that I  will continue watching and waiting for the time being.

I’m a relatively healthy teenager. I’m very advanced in swimming, I practice boxing, and I play soccer a lot. Never in my life have I ever been concerned over any health issues. I be jackin off sometimes I can’t lie, but it’s not a daily practice.

However, since March I’ve experienced some issues in the bathroom. My piss smelled like rotten eggs and I struggled to pee easily. In April of this year, it seemed to get worse, and I started worrying. I’ve had these following issues:
-excessive urination at night
-I never seemed to be done peeing
-I couldn’t hold in my pee as long
-sometimes an ill feeling in the area
-a lot of dribbling after peeing
-my stream was inconsistent 
-and very recently, I’ve noticed I cannot hold an erection as long

I started to wonder why I felt this. 

Maybe it was because in March I held in my pee for 16 hours. It’s a long story, but basically I was in a public with no restrooms. I felt a cramp throughout my body after that lmao. 

I also wonder if it was from masturbation. So I stopped for about a week but nothing got better. So I gave up.

My last thought was that maybe it was from how much sea water I ingest accidentally from surfing. That thought didn’t really lead to much.

927,"5 Common Questions About Cancer, Answered: Below for 5 more!",2,hq3a8f,ProstateCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/hq3a8f/5_common_questions_about_cancer_answered_below/,2,"1. Who gets cancer?

Anyone can get cancer, although the risk goes up with age. Your individual risk depends on factors such as whether you smoke, lifestyle choices such as what you eat and how much you exercise, your family history of cancer, and factors in your workplace and environment.

2. How does cancer start?

Your body is made up of many different types of cells. Under normal conditions, cells grow, divide, become old, and die. Then, in most cases, they’re replaced by new cells. But sometimes cells mutate grow out of control, and form a mass, or tumor, instead of dying.

Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancerous tumors can attack and kill your body’s tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body, causing new tumors to form there. This process is called metastasis and it represents cancer that has advanced to a late stage.

3. Is cancer genetic?

Cancer is, in fact, a genetic disease. This is because cancer is caused by mutations or changes to genes that control the way our cells function, causing them to behave irregularly. These mutations can be inherited, as they are in about 5-10 percent of all cancer cases, but it’s much more likely that these gene changes occur during a person’s lifetime due to other factors besides genetics.

When someone has a known family history of hereditary cancer, genetic testing is often recommended.

4.Is cancer contagious?

No. Cancer isn’t like the flu or a cold. You can’t catch cancer from someone who has the disease.

5. Is there a vaccine for cancer?

There is no vaccine for cancer. But there are vaccines for some viruses that are known to cause cancer, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B.

HPV can cause cancer and getting vaccinated against it can help protect against the types of HPV that can lead to cervical, anal, throat, and penile cancers, along with some other forms of cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against many strains of the virus that can cause these cancers.

The same is true for infection with the hepatitis B virus, which has been linked to liver cancer. Getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk for getting liver cancer.

I'm hoping to get a bit of candid insight from you those of you who have been in similar situations yourself or with family members.  I am aware you are not medical professionals and that each case varies from person to person.

My dad is 61 and was diagnosed a week ago with stage 4 prostate cancer.  He had no symptoms whatsoever until this past January (some low-grade back pain between his shoulders intermittently).  A few weeks later, he developed shooting pain/numbness in one of his legs.  The pain got very severe and he started having trouble walking; this went so far as falling at one point.  Luckily he was not injured in the fall.  

Eventually, he got an MRI which showed a mass between his shoulder blades which was successfully removed.  The mass, conversely, came back malignant. A bone scan showed shadowing in my dad's pelvis, spots in his ribs, and his left arm.  His PSA was extremely elevated (~200 I believe).  

He's currently at an inpatient rehab center undergoing extensive therapy to get use of his legs again.  The only treatment he's receiving for the cancer is hormone therapy via both a shot and pill.

His spirits are high, he feels OK (though frustrated) and has an appetite.  He also looks like himself.  Before this incident, he was a generally healthy person.

Due to family dynamics/my dad's own level of medical literacy, I'm a bit in the dark despite visitng with my dad every day or so.  Some of my more specific questions are around treatment: does this seem like enough?  I thought homrone therapy will stop or slow progression for a bit, but does he need something further to eradicate what he has?  What is a realistic prognosis?  I apologize for my ignorance; again, I am not getting a lot or very good information so I am trying to piece things together and prepare myself for what's to come.

Thank you so much, I wish you all the best of luck on your own journeys.

This test is the first molecular test for prostate cancer screening.

Here we review 3 recently reported studies that examined the role of uPM3 as a novel diagnostic tool for early-stage prostate cancer.

I know there are plenty of posts/threads about temporary (or permanent...) impotence resulting from ***treatment*** for prostate cancer (prostatectomy, hormone therapy, radiation, etc.), but does anyone have any experience with impotence resulting from the cancer itself?

I have had benign prostate hyperplasia for years, but due to some other more recent developments (blood clots) there is a suspicion that I now have prostate cancer itself.  I am due to have a biopsy in early January, so we will see.  But one thing that has happened more recently is virtually total impotence -- whether with my wife or even with the old reliable hand.  Has anyone ever gone through this experience?

PSA was initially low, but rising, even after stopping TRT.  Really wanted to avoid needle biopsy. 

No family history.  No urinary complaints.  DRE=nothing, although prostate is large (which means nothing).  Culture=no bacterial prostatitis.  MRI=1 feature ""favors prostatitis"", 1 feature ""chance of prostatitis and clinically significant cancer are equivocal"" (oh crap!).  Free PSA was 22%, but PSA dropped to 2.2 on that test date, urologist pointed out cancer-driven PSA doesn't just drop on its own, so I decided to stop worrying about it. 

Followed up 6 months later and PSA was up to 3.86.  PSA's value in predicting anything is pretty questionable, as is DRE, but the urologist kept reminding me biopsy is how they ""make sure"", except even needle biopsy also is not certain (false-neg may go be as high as 35%).  Needle biopsy really wasn't looking like a great idea, it comes with significant risk, the chance of there being any cancer of concern was pretty questionable, but even a neg really doesn't answer the question with high confidence where I can just stop worrying about it.  And I was worrying.    Some people undergo repeat biopsies after negs.  And in some cases the second or third still finds cancer missed earlier.  

I'm not ok with undergoing this somewhat-risky biopsy procedure that really can't offer a completely conclusive result.

He brought up SelectMDx, new patented single-source noninvasive test (well they massage your prostate for a few sec via DRE to express fluid, then do a urine sample).  Looks for mRNA biomarkers.  It's supposed to be *more* accurate than needle biopsy, which can't find a cancer it doesn't physically go through.

Well just got the results back: ""Very Low Risk for Gleason >=7 with 95% negative predictive value"".  Although, it's kinda vague on explanation of ""why"" underneath.  There are no objective measurements from that test, just that final summary.

SelectMDx seems to have the science behind it though, esp for proven reliability on a negative being a true negative.  And this is a negative.  Better than 4K score by the look of it.
