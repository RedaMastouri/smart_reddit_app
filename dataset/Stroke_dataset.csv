15,For the Young Stroke Survivors,57,ebxv6o,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ebxv6o/for_the_young_stroke_survivors/,25,"I just hit the five-year mark of having a stroke in my late-twenties. I've never really talked or posted about what happened on a public forum, but thought I'd offer words of encouragement. 

At the time, it devastated my life. Via heart arrhythmia, I took a blood clot to the right side of the brain.  I lost about 40-50% of control/motor ability on the entire left side of my body. I lost my ability to play guitar, sing, play sports, run, etc. It put me in debt, destroyed my dating life, and impacted my mental health to the point that I was suicidal. I lived alone, and would have nightmares that I would pass away in my house and nobody would find me for an extended period of time. 

(ok, sad part is over)

If you're struggling, there is light on the other side of this journey. Once I accepted my life would never be the same, I started viewing the abilities I was slowly regaining as small victories and it flipped the narrative completely. I became more in tune with my mental health, I started taking care of my body, and progress started to show.

Recovery is easier said than done, and I do have my bad days (and that's ok). 

My speech and motor abilities have come a long way. My foot drop is really manageable. I've driven across the United States. I've met an amazing woman. I've seen Prague, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Munich. I've tried dancing ( with not much success). I've improved my relationship with family members, etc. I assure you, I wouldn't have accomplished any of this if I wouldn't have gained the perspective that my stroke gifted me. I'm still human and I still take things for granted - but far less often. 

If you're going through it now, I'm sorry. You have a lot of work ahead of you, but don't let the dark drown out all your light. The hard part was surviving, now go kick some ass.

17,My fianc√© (f28) had a stroke. This is our story.,56,c1727a,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/c1727a/my_fianc√©_f28_had_a_stroke_this_is_our_story/,15,"Some background info:

We are both 28 and healthy. Biking, outdoors, and our two pups are the center of our life. She works in education and I work in healthcare. We just got engaged a short bit ago after living together for over a year. I just got a new job that more than doubled my income and lessened my time at work, and she just got onto summer break from teaching. We were planning a wedding, saving up for a house, and spending time soaking in Alaskan summer together. Things were absolutely perfect. However, Tuesday night our life would change for forever...

&#x200B;

I was at work and it was turning into a very busy shift. She texted once in a while and I would get back to her when I had a few minutes here and there. At about 7:30PM she started sending a few text messages that were confusing, but they weren't alarming. I saw them come in on my watch, but decided to not really deal with any of them. I had a short break and decided to grab dinner and respond to her texts. Maybe give her a call to say hi. It was nearly 10PM at this time. It had been 3 hours and 30 minutes since the stroke had occurred.

&#x200B;

I was walking around trying to size up the scene of all the yummy foods I had available to me and grabbed my phone out of my pocket. She had texted me a few times while I was getting ready to take a break. I read her texts and nothing she said made sense. She has the dogs with her. She is doing stuff. Maybe she just fat fingered her texts and sent them in haste? I didn't really know. She would later explain she was afraid to say anything about her not feeling right because she didn't want to bother anyone. Our puppy cam somehow recorded the whole timeframe in which she would first start showing symptoms. She simply laid on the floor and then got up and watched TV trying to see if the symptoms would go away. After texting to ask her if she could talk she simply said, ""only text,"" ""i can't talk."" I promptly ignored that as I felt it was a little too weird and called her. She answered the phone with panic in her voice. I couldn't understand anything she was saying, but I've seen aphasia in my own patients. My lizard brain immediately kicked in as I ran down some different diagnoses. Stroke... STROKE... IT'S A DAMN STROKE. No. Nope. Couldn't be. She's 28 and healthy! No way. Shut up. I asked her, ""Have you been drinking? Are you hurt?"" She struggled, but said ""no."" I told her to hang on and I would call her right back. I called my cousin to come by and check on her. I called her back and started asking her questions, ""What's wrong... Like what else is wrong with you. What's not normal."" She said, ""My face is numb..."" Panic ensued. I told her to hang up with me and call 911 immediately. She panicked. We both were panicking. I've seen this in real life so many times in other people, but -nothing- prepares you for this. I called my mom. I didn't know what else to do.

&#x200B;

Ambulances arrived at our home and my fianc√© was at the front door waiting for them. They initially were confused, but I am incredibly thankful they quickly caught onto the fact that this wasn't her being drunk or on drugs. They had somehow figured out what was going on. They took her to the hospital where she was in the ED and got a CT almost immediately. I work about 45 minutes away from this hospital, but made it there in 30 minutes. (Thankful there was a lack of cops on my route.) I arrived in the ED and my mom had called one of her good friends to be there with her since my mom lives in a different town. Her family lives across the country. She was so scared. She is so strong and such a stubborn woman. When I saw how scared she was it took almost everything I had to not break down right there. She later on would tell me that she was worried I was going to leave her after seeing her like that. She said I was silent and stoic. In fact I was in pure panic. I just didn't know what to do or say. Shortly after I got there they decided that this wasn't from a bleed, and that they were -barely- inside the window to give TPA. So they did. At almost exactly 4 hours after the stroke occurred.

&#x200B;

After being in the ER for what felt like 15 minutes, but was closer to 2 hours they admitted her to the ICU to be watched because of her having been administered TPA. Life after this gets suuuuper blurry. She slept. A lot. Her speech was still really hard to understand. It had been determined that she had right sided deficits with right arm weakness, right facial droop, and aphasia. I was still praying to whatever power existed in the universe that this wasn't a stroke, but it was. What comes next? Will we still be able to get married? Will she need to live in a nursing home? Will things EVER be normal again? No one could answer any of this. She would routinely wake up, look at me, and just cry. I wanted to cry, but I wanted to be her stability. At about 4AM I told her I needed to go home, change out of my uniform, shower, and sleep. She agreed I should go home to rest. We both knew that this would be a loooong road ahead. I walked out to the car and made a few phone calls... And cried. I cried so much I didn't know if I could drive or even if it was safe to drive. Eventually I sobered up a little and made it home. Cried in the shower for about a half hour. My cousin had made it to my home in the flurry of all this to take care of the dogs and button up the house if needed. He waited for me to get home. He said when I walked in the door I looked ""empty."" I guess whenever he kept asking me questions I would just tell him, ""Man... I just don't fucking know.""

&#x200B;

I woke up at 7AM and hurried to the hospital to make rounds. This would be a long day of just waiting around and tests. Blood draws, echocardiogram, doppler tests for DVTs in her legs. There was some times with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. She didn't sleep that night, and spent most of her day between seeing different clinicians napping or eating. We tried to watch Netflix, but she was too tired to keep her attention on anything. She was also having too much difficulty speaking still so conversations were stressful and difficult. She would later tell me it felt like she was trapped inside her own head. She knew what she wanted to tell other people, but simply couldn't get it out. We barely talked to any doctors this day except her neurologist. He was a tall, round man who sounded a bit German. He was very short, but not impolite. That night right at the 24 hour mark she would be getting an MRI on her head. We wouldn't hear the results until the next later afternoon, and it was excruciating. We would see some mild improvements today. She would regain the vast majority of her gross movement skills in her right arm, but her speech was slow and deliberate. Not so confused today, though.

&#x200B;

Day two would be her last day in the ICU. Still basically zero contact with a physician besides the round neurologist. However today was more improvements. She would be able to hold a conversation with our first visitors, and could brush her hair and her teeth for the first time without help. The one thing that did happen that was the most frustrating thing, and when I realized that I was extremely defensive on her behalf, is a friend talked down to her. This person talked slowly and loudly to her as if she was dumb or as if the stroke had made her stupid. Emotions were still high this day. We still cried a lot. I tried to not let this incident bother me.

&#x200B;

Day three was a ton of waiting around. She got transferred from the ICU to the Neuro unit this afternoon, but there wasn't enough beds available so we would hang out for a bit longer in the ICU. I did get a chance to pry some info out of the day shift nurse that was assigned to our room in the ICU. He showed me the interpretations of the tests so far. Everything was normal except her echo showed the bubble test was positive for a PFO. Just what we need... Another problem. Soon after we finally got a physician to talk to us! YES! He explained EVERYTHING. Her MRI showed that she had a small ischemic stroke to the left lower basal ganglia. It didn't seem to be severe, but it was there. All of her blood tests were normal. I think we finally ended up being transferred shortly before dinner time. The neuro unit basically only gave her a quick assessment and let her mostly rest most of the night. This was certainly the most sleep either of us got since this all happened. Turns out ICUs are bustling with business all hours of the night. Rest was clearly not a part of their healing regiment, but thankfully we were low on the list of priorities compared to most of the other patients in the unit. We did get a chance to get her a shower the first night in the neuro unit. She walked in a stinky stroke victim, and walked out a less stinky one, but was more happy about the shower than anything else so far.

&#x200B;

Day four would be our most boring, and exciting day yet. She woke up better than ever! We got news early in the day that she might get discharged! PT had signed off on her, OT said she was ready for outpatient stuff, and her speech person also said she was good to go. All we needed was to hear back from the cardiologist regarding her PFO. He said a bunch of stuff and a ton of questions were asked, but basically he told her that surgery was in her near future. It would require to be fixed, but it was not going to require major surgery. It would be outpatient. PHEW! Bullet dodged. About 3 hours later we got discharge papers...

&#x200B;

The last couple of days have been filled with emotional moments. So many times she has told me she never thought we would make it here, and indeed I feel like we've won the lottery. We have a new lease on life, and feel like this has made us stronger than anything ever could have. SHE RODE HER BIKE TODAY... Just up and down the driveway a couple times, but holy cow! How exciting is that?!? Her speech is basically normal, but she has some slurring once in a while and has to remind herself to talk more slowly. Her arm strength has almost entirely resolved. Sometimes she has some issues, but it mostly comes around when she's stressed or tired. Her face... I don't know if it'll ever totally be normal, but her smile to me is the best thing ever. Not long before this I didn't think I'd ever see that smile again, but it creeps up into the corner of her mouth when she truly smiles. The remnants of herself before the stroke are a reminder to me of how lucky she is. It reminds me to hold all of the moments of health and happiness that we have so close and to cherish all the time we share together.

&#x200B;

I apologize for this being a small book, but I think it's important to see this whole cycle. While I was watching her suffer in that bed. Scared, anxious, and unsure of her future. I wanted to give her something to latch onto. My job is to help sick people, but when that sick person was my own I couldn't do anything except barely hold back tears. It is okay to be scared during all this. It is okay to cry. I had to remind myself of all this every single moment of every single day. All of this has forever changed me as an individual, a professional, and a partner.

Now that it's been two weeks since your post, I hope your fianc√© continues to improve. It's great that her doctors are recommending surgery to close the PFO. My first stroke was when I was 15 (1994). At the time, they didn't do a bubble study and were unable to determine the cause. They just put me on a daily aspirin and called it good. Flash forward to 2011 when I had TIA symptoms and went to the ER. After that, a TON of tests were ordered (including a bubble study). I found out that I had a PFO, but my neurologist at the time didn't recommend closure. He just wanted to wait and see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn January 2016, I had my second stroke, which included severe aphasia like your fianc√© experienced. Fortunately, I had a full recovery (well, friends and family would say I'm at 100%, but I feel like I'm at 90% or so). This time, they recommended closure of the PFO (finally!). I had it closed in June of 2016 using the catheter procedure. When they were in there, they realized it was actually an ASD, and a big one - 17mm. But, they closed it and the results were fairly dramatic. I felt like I had more energy, I started to get fewer migraines, etc. Hard to know how much of that was due to the closure or if it was just an altered mental state due to the extra peace of mind. Either way, I would definitely recommend pursuing it. It sounds like your doctors are fully on board with doing the surgery, which is great! Best of luck to you and your fianc√© as you journey through the recovery process!!""]",18

The stroke occurred in the Wernicke's area of her brain and now she has aphasia.\n\nDue to a very long wait on getting approved for Medicaid, she has been in speech therapy for about six months at this point and has made huge improvements.\n\nWhen my mom first had her stroke, for all intents and purposes, she could not speak, read or write. The woman who could EASILY talk on the phone 2+ hours was now talking to me for 10 minutes at a time at a stretch. She couldn't use her phone, laptop, TV functions, she couldn't cook or manage her own medicines.\n\nHer speech has come a long way in the last six months, it's certainly not perfect, but she is now mostly able to be understood. She still needs some help with her phone, laptop and TV, but for the most part she is managing the basic things on her own and she is cooking and managing her medications without any kind of help.\n\nThat's not to say that all of these things don't come with much more difficulty than they used to, but at least she is able to do them. \n\nShe is more emotional than she used to be, she cries a fair bit more easily than she used to. When she gets tired, her functionality seems to wane along with it, though I feel like that is lessening over time. In the initial months following her stroke, she would go from somewhat understandable to mostly completely not able to be understood when she was tired. Also, initially, she was sleeping and napping much more often which was encouraged by her medical team. She's not napping as frequently now, but still does occasionally.\n\nAnyway, all of this is to say, don't give up hope. Don't hedge your bets on a miracle, but things CAN change in a positive way. I'm not going to lie, in the first few months after my mom's stroke, I felt like I had lost her, you know, the real her. As time goes by it is becoming more and more apparent that MY mom, my real mom, is still there. And though things have changed up, things would change anyway, we all change throughout our lives.

Everything from here is in my hands to do on my own. But I've come so far already. My memory is practically baseline. I can walk without a cane and most times without even my ASO. And I can type, it's slow but I can individually move my fingers so I just need practice!

44,My Stroke Story (250 lbs to 175 lbs),38,olkaao,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/olkaao/my_stroke_story_250_lbs_to_175_lbs/,8,"I posted this pic in r/progresspics (I hope it posts here) and then wondered if my story 7.5 months later might encourage others. I‚Äôll start by saying I fully recognize that my stroke pales compared to what others have had to experience. Still, it was very real to me, and the fear and uncertainty were almost paralyzing on top of the physical issues.

My story:

On Tuesday, November 3, 2020, I woke up with tingling from left shoulder to fingertips and left hip to toes. I had trouble walking and using my arm. I determined that I slept wrong last night and pinched a nerve. I went through the rest of the day the best I could and went to bed thinking everything would be fine in the morning. I woke up Wednesday feeling even worse than I did the day before and figured I should probably get checked out. Note: For at least 15 years prior to this I had considered myself healthy and decided there was no need to go to the doctor. So I never did.

When I arrived at the ER, I was the only patient there. They asked me about my medical history, and I told them there was none. I‚Äôd never been sick; there was nothing to report. After taking my blood pressure at 223/123 things started to get real. The room I was in sprung into action. There were people everywhere. Much of that experience is blurred in my mind, but I remember many exams, tests, drugs, questions, scans, etc. The fear of what I had done to myself really started to set in when they took me to the ICU, and I became terrified for my life. After spending 5 days in the hospital, it was determined I had no cognitive defects, no slurred speech, and no vision issues. My deficiencies were all located in my left limbs. I did not have diabetes or any heart issues. I did have high blood pressure, was severely obese at 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 250 pounds, and might have sleep apnea. I have always been a non-smoker and non-drinker. I was released to in-patient therapy for 10 days and then sent home with outpatient therapy lined up.

As of July 16, 2021:

I have spent the time since coming home on November 20

\- listening to my doctors,

\- researching what I could online,

\- being more active,

\- getting stronger,

\- eating better,

\- losing weight,

\- grateful for my lifelong Faith in God,

\- and enjoying a new perspective on practically everything.

I am down from 250 to 175 lbs, BP is rountinely 115/75, stronger than I have been in quite some time, more rested than ever, only taking 1 BP med, 1 Cholesterol med, and one asprin. My doctors, OT, and PT have all said they don‚Äôt want to see me again, except for my annual physical. As a bonus, I went shopping for a whole new wardrobe as I needed to replace my XXL shirts with mediums, and 42 pants with 32‚Äôs.

I still have a lot to learn about nutrition and exercise. I still have some personal goals I want to reach as far as my left side is concerned, but I‚Äôm taking everything one day at a time and trying to learn something new along the way.

As I mentioned at the top. My experience pales in comparison to what many have experienced. I recognize fully that for whatever reason, I was lucky and incredibly blessed as it could have been so much worse. I wouldn‚Äôt wish a stroke on anyone, but looking back on it, I am incredibly grateful as I don‚Äôt think I would have woken up to my poor life decisions if it hadn‚Äôt been for November 3.

Please know that while I‚Äôm not an expert on anything, I am happy to share any encouragement, prayers, and amateur advice on what to learn more about for anyone interested.

TLDR: Stroke on 11/3/2020. 7.5 months later, I feel better now than I have in over a decade.

45,I had a stroke at 18,37,n20dj2,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n20dj2/i_had_a_stroke_at_18/,14,"A few months ago in August, I had a stroke after I had an embolization procedure to drain fluid from my brain before getting a tumor removed. The tumor in my brain was from Von-Hippel Lindau syndrome, a genetic condition that runs on my moms side. 

I graduated high school in June of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic. I was perfectly able before the stroke, and I was driving to school every day before we migrated to online classes. I was living a really unhealthy lifestyle, eating probably around 1000 calories a day or less, smoking pot every day, vaping. Even so the last two years of high school were among the most fun times of my life. After graduation my family and I took a trip to Cancun for two weeks, we had a fun time.

Around a week or two after I came home from our trip, I started to have really bad headaches for two days before I told my mom and she took me to the hospital. They did an mri of the brain and found the tumor, and diagnosed me with VHL syndrome. I remember the doctor that came in and explained the whole situation made it seem like everything was going to be fine and the team that was going to take care of me and operate on me were good at what they did and I would be totally ok and everything would be good. 

I stayed in the hospital for about a week before I had the procedure done on me (embolism) and what I remember is that I had a series of very strange, some scary dreams that lasted for a day or two I think, I don‚Äôt know exactly but it felt like I was in there for a while. Then I woke up in the ICU. I realized that my body was extremely weak, and my muscle memory and sensation in most of my body was gone. Although, my cognitive abilities and personality were completely fine thankfully. I also was trached and hooked up to a ventilator, so I couldn‚Äôt speak and only could communicate by mouthing words or nodding.

I wasn‚Äôt in shock. I think my brain was protecting itself by only letting me process the whole situation slowly, so that I wouldn‚Äôt be overwhelmed. I‚Äôm still amazed by how well I handled it, since being stuck to a bed, unable to speak or eat for 3 months would probably destroy a person. Yes, I was unable to eat by mouth for 6 months. I was receiving nutrition solely by feeding tube, and being exposed to food was the hardest thing for me. Watching Netflix in the ICU was the only thing I had to pass time, since my hands were too weak to use my phone or type, and the rest of my body was out of the question. I saw the entirety of breaking bad for the first time so that was cool. After 3 months in the hospital my family finally decided to arrange for me to come home, and I continued my recovery there.

It was late November and I had finally come home. No more IVs and wires everywhere, but I had to stay on a new bed in my living room rather than my actual room upstairs, for ease of access and I had a nurse at my side all the time. It was a step up from being in the hospital, and I could finally sleep at night peacefully without being waken up to take blood or whatever. I also started to use a speaking valve, which I slowly got accustomed to. I still couldn‚Äôt eat so it was frustrating smelling food or hearing my family talk about food. I was tired of mouthing my words and making people guess what I had to say, so I started training my voice with the speaking valve since I could handle it, and 2 months after going home I got off the ventilator completely. I passed my swallow exam around the beginning of March and I was pretty much able to eat most things, and drink honey thick liquid.

I also started outpatient rehab about 2 months ago, with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to help with my swallowing. I was receiving pt in the hospital and doing exercises at home every day, but I really started to do harder work in outpatient rehab. They have me practicing walking with a walker, and OT has me practicing my motor skills. It‚Äôs been 8 months but I‚Äôve recovered immensely. I can eat most things, I don‚Äôt have incontinence, and I can speak. I‚Äôm either in bed or a wheelchair but my goal is to be walking with at least a cane by 4 months since I start college in September.

Having to go through this experience made me appreciate the small things a lot more in life. I never would have expected this would happen to me at such an early age. Who has a stroke at 18 years old? I was pissed that the operation caused me to have a stroke, but at least I‚Äôm alive and well on my way to recovery. If I continued the lifestyle I was living before, I probably would have had other health problems anyway. It was probably a wake up call for me to clean up my act. I went from around 95 pounds before the stroke to about 130 now since I‚Äôm eating a lot more (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10). I‚Äôm now committed to living as healthy as I can, in case any other tumors caused by my genetic condition require me to have an operation I‚Äôll be in my best possible condition so that something like this doesn‚Äôt happen again.

47,OT Tip: It's Not an Arm Thing. It's a Brain Thing.,37,kx7iet,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/kx7iet/ot_tip_its_not_an_arm_thing_its_a_brain_thing/,6,"If you struggle with limited arm movement, it can be an easy jump to say, ‚ÄúThe problem is my arm.‚Äù  **When in fact, the problem isn‚Äôt the arm, it‚Äôs in the brain.**    


When someone has a stroke, brain cell death occurs. Because of this cell death, that part of the brain can‚Äôt communicate with the muscles or other areas of the brain effectively. **This can result in a disruption in the way we think, make it difficult for us to speak, or limit our arm and leg movement.**  The surrounding area of the brain has to find alternative pathways to more effectively communicate.             


**Neuroplasticity in a nutshell.**    


So how do we encourage the brain to find and create these alternative pathways?    


* **Use it or lose it**. This seems like an easy conclusion, but it has to be put into practice. The brain is like a muscle. We have to practice what we want to improve so we don‚Äôt lose the ability to do it all together. ‚Äã  

* **Use it to improve it.** Another seemingly easy conclusion that must also be put into practice. You wouldn‚Äôt expect a new musician to pick up an instrument and be able to play a hard piece perfectly.

Since my insurance covers a gym membership through silver sneakers I joined a nearby gym with a pool & started walking in the water there after giving up on my foot falling off the pedals of the exercise bikes.  The resistance of the water alone would have been a huge help years ago when I was (barely) walking with a cane, but it didn't take long for me to start looking on amazon & such for resistance cuffs for my ankles.  [These](https://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAFGFCJLTDRD/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HPBTNK9) turned out to be an incredible solution for me & after a few months of building up with the medium resistance ones I can do 1-2 hours a day with my heartrate up the whole time &  looking forward to getting the next step up soon.

I wanted to throw a party the day I managed to step>move cup>step>repeat to get a cup of coffee to my computer unaided years back.  Then again I saw a lot of gradual improvement in hard to describe areas when I made my way up to walking without a cane, but eventually there was a wall where progress seemed to be done.  Walking forward/backwards/left/right with the fins has been improving my foot placement & building muscle in my legs to help with things like not having my foot fall off my knee when putting on socks & such because I can keep it in place with muscles instead of mere hope & luck.

With the water's resistance to slow/support me & take most of the weight off my ankles I can push myself much harder than  I could dream of doing outside of the pool & I'm seeing real progress again thanks to the muscle building & nerves waking up with the fins without the joint pain & sore muscles I used to associate with exercise.",2021-07-13 02:12:03+00:00,"['Great progress!

I ignored it, but then he goes back in his car and does it again. Now I'm not the type of person to start a fight, but I'm also not the type of son to let you hit my mothers car twice with your door without saying something.

So I roll down the window and I ask him to be careful, you keep hitting my car with your door. Of course he does what you would think someone who would hit your car door would do, he goes through a laundry list of excuses and justifications instead of being decent by apologizing, being mindful of other people and going about your day. At that point I had a hard time communicating because of the spasticity in my cheek and I had to repeat myself twice so I wanted to end the conversation. Then I just simply asked him if there was a scratch there because I physically couldn't look down to see, that's when he just went off.

He started screaming right next to my window just being belligerent and I was genuinely confused how someone can be so hostile over something so little. So I didn't say anything and just stared at him as he walked away screaming obscenities to himself as if I really just somehow offended him by pointing out he keeps hitting my car with his door.

It wasn't until after the altercation that I realized that I put myself in a really vulnerable position, i'm not sure if he realized I was disabled, but he could have easily lunged at me through the window in his bout of rage. I'm 35 and I've always been able to handle myself, I don't start fights but I've never backed down from one in my entire life and for the first time I was suddenly aware of my mortality, strangely more in that moment then when I had my stroke.

Now this guy was 5'10 260 lbs, he wasn't a muscular guy but you can tell it wasn't all fat. I wasn't scared in the moment, what I felt was disappointment and shame, I came to the realization that I couldn't protect myself and more importantly I couldn't protect those I cared for anymore. This has mentally been weighing on me ever since that happened yesterday afternoon. I feel weak and helpless but I don't want to live my life walking on egg shells hoping I don't run into a monster.

Everyone notices our physical disabilities, but no one ever shines a light on the mental toll suddenly becoming disabled takes on you. What has become painfully obvious this past year since I've had my stroke is that this world doesn't cater to the disabled as much as you think and it certainly doesn't slow down for a second.

PS. The ironic part, he stood there in front of his car the whole time waiting for me to leave and as we pulled away I saw him check his door to see if I did something to it, of course I did nothing.",2021-06-11 08:38:54+00:00,"['I\'d have rolled the window up, taken out a phone, and taken his picture.

Info went in and was basically on demand without needing to document details or practice a skill too much. I could retain that knowledge for a long while...years In many cases...without revisiting it. 

Since the stroke I find I can't retain details for any length of time. A week at most. Which at work is proving to be a struggle. I've never been a good note taker because I never needed that skill. But now if I don't document something so I can review it...that info is just gone.

I haven't yet figured out how to manage with this new brain. Does anyone else have this experience? What are you doing to manage? Are there any apps you use for taking quick and concise notes if you're In a meeting or a class?

Time management is still something I struggle with along with remembering everything I‚Äôm doing, or have to do.  It‚Äôs a slow relearning process, I am the mother of three active teenagers so our schedule never stops, time management and task tracking is very helpful to keep me from becoming overwhelmed, frustrated and angry.', 'Like other suggested, I needed jot down all important matters.  In fact, I have been managing all important aspects of my life by using my computer - to take notes using OneNote, add all important appointments and reminders on my calendar, prefer to use email to phone calls, keep track of my daily routines using Excel and so forth.\n\nWhat led me to building a habit of recording everything electronically are the following reasons:\n\n1) I was often forgetting things and not remembering much.  Or like you, not able to retain details.\n\n2) I did not know what to info to share when seeing doctors - especially to the questions ""how have you been doing?"" and ""what has been bothering you the most?"".  And I did not like having a blank face while there were many challenges I wanted to discuss prior to those visits. \n\n3) when filling out various forms, particularly the ones for disability insurance, I felt I was not providing sufficient information because I could not remember all the facts.  As a result, I felt that my forms were incomplete even after several months after submitting them.  \n\n4) as I started using PC and smartphones for all my records, I wanted to use apps and services that are always in sync and thus I can record/retrieve them at any time on whichever device I am on.  \n\n5) by using email, I can save them as draft and return to it later in the day or in the next few days to ensure that I am properly composing or replying by putting together all important info (vs. with phone calls, whenever I get a question, I would pause and try to think what my response should be and I often could not come up with good answers).\n\nIn addition to keeping track all the information to lessen the load on my brain, I have been using some brain training apps and games (such as sudoku) that I play for about 10 to 15 minutes a day so that I can keep my brain active.\n\nI would suggest you trying various options (electronic, pen/paper, pictures, whiteboard, etc.) to see which option works best for you and stick to it once you land on the best option.  The bottom line is that you have a new brain indeed because the old brain sustained some damage and your brain is now trying to figure out how to rewire itself to compensate for lost functionalities: you likely have seen the term neuroplasticity while looking up for brain recovery info online.

I found it accurate for me. There are a bunch of them out there for free. They have a few strategies based on your preferences. taking info in, in a varieties of ways is usually helpful. ie you hear it, then write it, then do it or see it, then teach it, then make a song about it :) etc. \n\nDon't underestimate the importance of good diet and sleep for learning, but now add on mood/stress level, as in it will be way harder to learn/remember when you're stressed or in a bad mood or tired or in a distracting environment. I think the most important thing is to review the info periodically, ie immediately, 5 min later, a hour later, at the end of the day, the next day, the next week, etc. unfortunately repetition really is the name of the game. \n\nThere are smart tablets you can write on with a stylus to take notes with, but files are stored digitaly and much easier to search and keep track of than paper notes. I don't have personal experience with these, but have heard good things. \n\nIf there's a particular thing you want to work on, sounds like short term memory, find a fun way to do it so it doesn't feel like therapy. Lumosity is one we use in my work, you can pick specific games for short term memory. No shortage of apps out there.

I live interstate and had flown in as soon as it happened but given how well he was doing, I decided to go back on Tuesday morning after seeing him and see my sons, and return on the weekend to help them settle in at home. He was doing so well.

On October 3rd 2019 I had a massive stroke. At 7 pm I was at work and I felt my left side go numb. I left work and drove myself home after looking up my symptoms Google said I was having a stroke but I thought I was being silly. By 1am it was obvious what was happening and my fiance saw it and rushed me and the children into the van because our ambulance was not equipped to handle stroke victims. I did not know it at the time but my body had shut down and I had spoiled myself and defecated. I remember him calling 911 and getting permission to speed to the nearest hospital. Then my memory have out. 

So what happened after my memory gave out was I became lethargic 15 minutes after arriving to the hospital and it was obviously I had a bleed in my brain so I had to be life flighted. It was too foggy so they took me by ambulance to a bigger hospital with my chance of survival at 3% I immediately went in for brain surgery. After I successfully came out another bleed developed and I had to go back in. This time my chance of survival was 1% and if I came out of it I was going to be preeminent paralyzed and brain dead. 

Well somehow I pulled threw with an unexpected full recovery. I was in a coma for a bit and it was during this it was discovered I was pregnant with our fourth child. I was in the hospital for two months. 

Allot of crazy things happened when I was hospitalized. Not only did I have to relearn basic things but also grow a baby and on top of that the actions of those around me when they thought I was dying was atrocious. My fiance saved my life and had been my rock threw everything including this and we don't keep things from each other. On day two of retraining my memory I new something was wrong and that's when it all came out. 

So I lost my best friend when she decided to date my father. Her and I grew up together and I was disgusted. I never told them how I felt I just stopped speaking to her. My father hated my fiance but never let it be known until Istroke. Together my father and friends tried to get the doctors to abort my baby, told my children I was going to die, tried to take my children and my paychecks to support my family. They threatened and tried to send others over to ""take care""of my fiance and put my children in danger. When my fiance found out he took the children to victim services to be questioned and evaluated by doctors. They set up a safe house for him and the children as I was fighting for my life. When it was discovered that I was going to live they back peddled and threatened to kill my fiance if he told me.

I spent two months in silence ensuring their visits and waiting for them to tell me their side of the story but it never came. My fiance backed up everything with proof so I knew they lied bad. When I got out I told them u knew and cut them off entirely. It's 2021 now and my left hand doesn't work and I can walk with a cane but my brain has a hard time retaining memory. I did all this on my own. 

My son was born happy and healthy and I do my best to raise the kids half paralyzed. I do get help but at first it was hard cuz I removed most people from my life. I lost my job but I did alright mentally until now. I think I'm starting to show symptoms of ptsd. I'm not retaining memory much anymore and I spiral frequently.

Firstly, it's normal to feel a brain fog after a stroke, I felt that way for around a year. My brain works almost perfectly now (except, obviously, controlling my left side). So, don't feel to frightened, it's normal.

Secondly, listen to your therapists! I cannot stress this enough. Did you go to school to study therapy and the body? No? Then be quiet and listen!

Thirdly, you should be able to get a personal tens machine. I got this one: https://www.mdsupplies.com/medical-supplies-Dr-Franklyns-Digital-Muscle-Stimulator-EMS-M612SXSSK4.html

You can use it to stimulate your arm or leg. It should help your muscles ""wake up"".

Fourthly, speaking of waking up, don't rush recovery. I tried that and it was a bad idea. I got to a point where I could stand by myself, as well as transfer myself, and use the restroom, I only needed help in the bath. I felt hopeful, I went home early, had a fall, broke my good leg, and go im unable to stand at all. Don't rush, whatever you do. You're on recoveries schedule, now.

Lastly, im fairly young, I was 29 when my stroke happened, so, this is information for younger folks. I used to play video games a lot. Can't so much now. But, there is hope! A electronic engineer and frequent modder named Ben Heck makes one handed controllers! I have the Xbox One version, but he just recently released a ps4 version, too. This is some hope, I still cannot play certain games. Racing, fighting, fps games, they're all out. Rpgs are my jam, now, though. I also play games on my phone, the same one I am typing this message on, actually. Phone games are nice, because the touch controls are usually one handed.

I hope this has been helpful for other survivors. So far, my early 30's have not been to fun. I miss driving the most, though. I for I heal, though I hear it's a small overall chance, my therapist has said being younger should help my chances.

Apologies for any spelling errors. Im usually very good with grammar. I went to college for an English Literature degree. Lot of good that's doing me now, though.

Also focus on filling out or asking a trusted loved one to fill out paperwork for short term disability and any other types of assistance you may need to survive financially and/or to protect your job through FMLA.  Maybe get a lawyer too.  One thing that def worked against me is that despite the fact that I had a severe stroke and had less than 10% chance of survival and had an NDE, my initial recovery was nothing short of a miracle.  The doctors said they were ""cautiously optimistic"" I\'d make a full recovery.  I was so stressed fighting and advocating for my rehab and dealing with my sub standard healthcare system and fought to get more specialized treatment in a proper brain injury center and dealing with PTSD, depression, anxiety et al that adversely affected my first year of recovery.    I tried to to do much too soon, and although I did have some assistance, the more complex things were left up to me.  My (now) ex husband and my mother did not do their own research, buried their heads in sand and therefore didn\'t understand the holistic nature of brain injury.  Each time you progress or enter into a new environment, you push through certain limitations, but also can be overwhelmed and get neuro fatigue.  For example, hospital sounds were one thing, but walking down the street with ambulances or in a crowd or being a room of 6 people who were all talking at once completely overwhelmed me.  Get yourself into a proper brain injury rehabilitation center for PT, OT, aphasia, cognitive remediation therapy, etc.  Encourage your loved ones to attend stroke recovery for caregivers, so they can help themselves to help you.  Don\'t take ""No"" as an answer from doctors or insurance or loved ones regarding the amount of therapies or help you need.  And, ask only those who you trust and are doing the work to understand stroke rehabilitation.   Others who mean well can be an obstacle to your recovery.

It was a mild stroke caused by blockage from cholesterol build-up. I was in the hospital for 6 days and by the time I was discharged, I was already able to stand up (with assistance of course).

I'm aware though that a lot of people are not as fortunate as I was in my recovery, and that realization really changed my perspective on everything.

My doctors were proud that I was making really great progress, and it really was great! But no one ever warned me about the emotional and mental distress that follows. I had never felt sadness, anger, self-hatred, and guilt that strong in my life. It didn't help either that I was under the care of my emotionally abusive mother.

The one thing I longed for was support from other people who had gone through the same thing. I know my friends tried to help, but they did not understand the severity of what I was going through. I was so distressed that I pushed them away and I was wrong for doing so. In the end, I found myself being a toxic source for people around me.

Everyday, I try to be better than I was before. Some days I think back to the stroke and I have small breakdowns because I remember the pain. There was so much emotional and physical pain. I find it hard to talk about sometimes because I can't seem to put into words how much it hurts. I remember having intense muscle pain on my left side for several weeks. So painful I could barely eat.

Learning to walk again was difficult but I was determined. I knew that the sooner I got better, then I can be free from my mom's horrible treatment of me. Eventually after 4 months of physical therapy, I was discharged. I held it in when my PT told me I would no longer need therapy, and when I got home I broke down in tears. It was the first time I've felt happiness in months. I slowly started exercising more and more since I knew it was up to me now to recover. I think that's when I also started to heal emotionally.

I wish I had known about this sub back then. It really would've helped me greatly. I am better now, away from my mother as well. When I met my boyfriend a few months ago, I kept the stroke a secret and when I told him, he did not think any differently of me. I've reached out to friends that I pushed away too and I apologized for how I treated them.

I know I am a different person than I was back then. I hated who I was before. I was selfish, arrogant, and lazy. An overall bitch. Sometimes I still feel that I still hold those traits now, but my friends assure me that I've grown into a better person. I find it hard to believe since I hold so much guilt in me, but I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.

It's been over 2 years since the stroke. I'm running a lot again, I got my license to drive, I'm studying an engineering course, and I've surrounded myself with good people. We don't really talk about the stroke, but I do bring it up when I see it necessary. My doctor says that I should be an advocate for healthy living because of what I went through. Hahaha! I do tell my friends to always watch their health. I went from alcoholic and rebellious teenager to mom of the group. And I'm proud of that. :)

I feel like I've rambled on for a while. I just got a little emotional today because I saw a picture of when I was in physical therapy. Just needed to vent.

77,Does fatigue after stroke go away?,27,qhubas,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/qhubas/does_fatigue_after_stroke_go_away/,57,"I had a stroke a year ago, optionally i look fine but i am very tired on a daily basis, i read it is called ‚Äòfatigue‚Äô.

Can anyone relate to recovery after a stroke? Does the extreme tiredness go/grow away eventually or is this how my life will be from now? What to expect?

after chatting with u/AIHURR a few weeks ago, i come to you all today to share my story and a project i have been developing to help other young (and not so young) folks who share a similar experience. 

i am a 24 yo stroke survivor (ischemic stroke, july 2018), and although i am fortunate that I didn't suffer long term physical impairment, this experience has tremendously changed the person i am today, and how i view the world and myself. 

As a designer and masters student, I am currently working on a holistic therapeutic video game and server based virtual reality social platform for stroke recovery. So far, i have been developing the game based on my own experience, and what i personally went through.
Now, i am looking to develop the game further with the help of others, and their input! 

I am looking into developing this further after i graduate, and in a clinical context to properly assert the psychological benefits of such a game !

I would like to create a team of around 5-7 individuals (at this stage! Later on, hopefully, everyone will be able to take part in the project and play the game and participate in the social platform) who :

-have either had a stroke recently or in recent years ( with and without long term physical impairments ! Everyone is welcome.)
-are willing to assist me in reviewing the different features within the journey,
-are willing to offer some time to discuss the project as a whole, and as a group!


I was also thinking on posting in the community some polls regarding the game, and the different features so that more people can participate in the development process! 


Any thoughts so far on this? Any insight is valuable! 


warm wishes and thanks to all, stay safe!

I put a lot of thought into this article to keep it professional and make the information simple. Here's an excerpt from [Sex After Stroke](https://elysenewland.com/articles/sex-after-stroke) to give you an idea of what to expect:

""Talking about sex can sometimes be a taboo topic, so I wanted to clarify why I decided to write about it. Sex is something that often gets overlooked in the rehab process and by the time you get home, you likely won't reach out to a healthcare professional to ask questions. It can be embarrassing to ask about sex and intimacy.

Having sex after a stroke can be really **intimidating and scary**. A lot of survivors wonder, will this cause another stroke? Will I be able to function normally? Will I still feel attractive? How will I do it?

My goal is to answer these questions and give you some ideas to navigate these waters without feeling embarrassed. You may even want to read through this article with your partner. It can help them understand what you're dealing with and open the lines of communication between you, which you'll find is one of the most important pieces.""   


Edit: Thank you so much for the award!! And thank you all so much for being willing to share your experiences.

I am post stroke and have had some interesting sexual changes specifically around sensation. It's nice to see this talked about.

Since my stroke 3 months ago (thankfully I have almost fully recovered) whenever I , ahem, climax I loose a bit of control of my left hand which feels the need to tightly clench into almost a fist. ( really it‚Äôs more akin to the way the guy‚Äôs hand in American Werewolf in London clenches as he transforms).Oddly the clenching of my hand is also a very satisfying, though non-sexually so, physical feeling. Anyone else have something similar.. this seems to be lessening with time but it is a very interesting after effect.', 'An aquaintance of mine, who is the communications director of the Danish Brain Injury Association, wrote an excellent book about sex and intimacy following an aquired brain injury ( in Danish).', 'I needed this lets seeee <3', 'This is so helpful. As a strong stroke survivor this would have been incredibly helpful to have after the stroke for both myself and my wife. Thank you for working on this!', 'Now if only I can find a willing girl ... But thank you for the  write-up. It is a yeboo topic like you mentioned especially when discussing with your doctor', 'I was upfront with my OT and doctor about this. Lois of sensation and hypersensitivity made thing difficult but there was no way I was going to let that part of my life slide.\n\n\nGreat article.', 'Excellent article, thank you.', 'I was nervous about approaching sex after my strokes because I didn\'t know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had issues with pain before my strokes, but it was like my nerves got rewired and I was able to enjoy it more. I noticed a distinct difference in sensation even when kissing for the first time 8 months post-stroke, and describe it as ""getting high"" the first time I made out with my boyfriend.\n\nI\'ve seen many people talking about sex on various support groups online. Some people completely lose their drive, and some become insatiable. Sensations can be different. During the first several months you may have little to no sensation at all (like I did), only to find things completely turn around later.\n\nI think the most important thing is just to be patient and make sure your partner is understanding of your situation. If you have to take a break or back out, you should feel free to do so. Just be patient and willing to take time learning your new body, because what worked for you before might not work now, but with enough experimentation you might find something that works even better.', 'I was newly married when I had my stroke (in my 40s).  I remember the first time our mothers left after caring for me and it was like ""just the two of us"" again.  I was terrified because I had a stent and coils put in my neck and I was weak and fatigued, so I could not \'do\' as much.  I was advised no hyper extension or flexion of the neck.  It got easier with time, except the chaos and confusion of fighting and advocating for my healthcare got in the way.  The financial pressures, and eventual PTSD, depression and anxiety weighed on us, I felt abandoned, he dove deeper into drinking and denial, and we drifted.  At some point I asked for a new bed (not the bed I had my stroke in and wet the bed in as I was having the stroke -- you know like an energetic refresh with a new bed).  Then I wanted a separate bed just because my sleeping was erratic, he was a light sleeper, and I needed literal space.  Ex said ""No"" to both knowing how much I love sex and love cuddle time and that I would be back in to to do those things...  I needed time ""to get back in my body"".  Surgery is traumatizing.  My ex\'s eventual rejection and refusal of sex, and his unwillingness to step up and really be present with me in my recovery, only added to my feelings of fear, despair, anxiety, depression et al.  So, I think at the very least, after losing the dignity of being in hospital and having so many strangers examine and chat with me, of having to ask my ex husband to literally wipe my ass, after being given a laxative, in the hospital bathroom because I couldn\'t reach it (to which he refused at first, because somehow he didn\'t believe me), again, I think stroke support for individually the survivor and the caregiver and attending one together is so important.  Couples counseling, too.  I think love is an action.  Marriage is an action.  Intimacy is an action.  Without working together to achieve intimacy and sexual connection again, I mean, it\'s free, and it\'s something that\'s just between you and your lover/partner, what is the meaning of togetherness?  What is the meaning life, if not love?  Oxytocin and endorphins are a great release and euphoria and bonding chemicals.  I think if we had better and more sex, I know at least for me, that would have been comforting and would have made me feel connected to him and supported even if money was tight and our ""old"" life was gone.', '‚úçÔ∏è step 1.

Just one initially, but it was huge to me that I\'d actually remembered something.\n\nAlso give attention to your ability to *pronounce* properly.

She was bleeding in her brain and was in a coma with a machine breathing for her. Things were not looking good as she had to have a very risky procedure to put a stent in her brain. The doctors said that there was a chance that she would have a massive stroke that she would never survive. 2 nights after, she suffered from the strokes that the doctors were so scared about. They couldn't tell if she had 2 or 10. They told my boyfriend and his family that there was a 5-10% chance she would ever speak or walk again. They said she would most likely never breathe or eat on her own again. In the doctors' words, ""keeping her alive would be like keeping a vegetable alive"", and were giving them options to take her off of life support. The very next day, she became responsive again. A day after that, they were able to take the ventilator out and she was able to speak (very limited). Everyday since then, she has only gotten better. She is able to move both her right and left side. She is speaking just like she used to (not even slurring!). She is beginning to walk and has been eating on her own. Of course she is not in the same health as she was before, but she has proved every doctor wrong. They told us rehab would be a long journey (6 months- 1 year). She has been in rehab for a little over a week and they are already making plans to release her!

95,Four Years Later....,27,d4aj77,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/d4aj77/four_years_later/,5,"TL;DR: Had a stroke 4 years ago. Life is different but mostly good.   
Today is 4 years after my ischemic stroke.  I was lucky that after the first few days, I had no major mobility problems.  My speech and memory were another matter.   I still remember the first day the speech therapist visited me in the hospital.  She showed a list of ten words.  They were familiar, I could pronounce them, but I had no ideas what they were.  Talking was baffling.  I couldn't find the correct words when I talked or wrote.  I said he when I meant she.  I said floor when I meant flour.  I was terrified that I would not be able to do my job (I work in IT).  The very first thing I did when I got out of the hospital was to login into my computer at home.  I remembered the username and the password, and I was able to type in commands.  What a relief! I did 12 weeks of speech therapy and eventually got good enough to speak that I was able to go back to work. I still have glitches.  Last week, I was talking to someone about a song performed by Kelly Clarkson, but I all I could say was Carrie Underwood. Occasionally I just lose a word or a definition.  These are the WTF moments,  I think I'll always have them.      
Four years later,  I've learned to cope.  I hesitate a bit when answering questions, so I can select the correct words.  The faster I try to verbally respond, the more chance that I will stumble. My speech deteriorates when I get tired. Sometimes I forget a word and I have to stumble around to find a different way to get the idea across. I have a hole in my short term memory. I can finish a conversation and 30 seconds later not remember it.  I take notes and repeat back the notes to my co-worker. I use a lot of sticky notes to remember things.   Learning is harder.  It takes me more repetitions to learn and remember concepts and procedures.    I know that research has said that there is no real multi-tasking in the brain, just task switching.   My task switching is much slower. I try to avoid conversations while driving.  I can't keep track of two simultaneous conversations anymore, and I have to read in a quiet place.                                                                    
Adjusting to the new reality is sometimes frustrating. I feel like my wife thinks I've lost half of my brain.  Overall, I'm not complaining.  I know how fortunate I am and how much worse it could have been. I can walk.  I can talk.  I can comprehend.  These are gifts.  My stroke was home, on my front porch. An hour earlier I would have been driving my grandson on the freeway.  That still gives me chills.    
When I was on medical leave, I watched [a TEDTalk by Jill Bolte Taylor](https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en).  She describes her stroke and the aftermath.  I didn't have the moment of insight, but I was inspired by the recovery she made and her ability to share her message coherently. If she could come back, then so could I.  Mostly, I have.   
My insight from my stroke is twofold:  We need to make the most of our days on this earth, and we need to support those who are struggling.   I'm thankful for the things I've learned from this subreddit, and I hope I can be supportive of those who come here needing help.

It‚Äôs a very long, epic, and heartwarming story which many of you lived through with me.

> Each year that passes provides me with more gratitude for the life I'm fortunate enough to keep living. This past year has been without a doubt the most rewarding. I met and fell in love with my best friend, *girlfriend*, and together we've been chosen by our perfect kitty, Major Garland Briggs. I've never felt love so strong as the love our little family shares, and not a day goes by that I don't say it out loud to *girlfriend* and Major. 


> 7 years post-stroke feels like an eternity sometimes. Other times, it feels like yesterday that I was discharged from the hospital. Each day is a gift. I love that I can still open them up to see what's inside. Today is a good day.

101,Survivor‚Äôs guilt?,25,ndekoy,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ndekoy/survivors_guilt/,11,"My dad had a stroke the day after I turned 15 and it turned my life upside down. He was my best friend and cheerleader and everything changed overnight. 

It was a huge stroke, my family was very lucky that he survived. He spent a week in the icu, another three weeks in the hospital, then another two months in rehab. He had hemiplegia on the right side, only regaining movement in his hip and a little in his knee. I couldn‚Äôt talk to him the way we used to because his language was very limited. He became very easily frustrated and a bit impulsive. He struggled with his PT, OT, and speech therapies and the slow progress led him to be extremely depressed. I tried so many times to introduce him to things that he could do, but after a few years he mostly gave up.

Over time his health deteriorated. He had frequent migraines which he was going to the doctor for, but the doctor just chalked it all up to his history of stroke and never looked into it. Turns out the men on my father‚Äôs side of the family have inherited a rare congenital illness that affects the carotid artery that was causing the headaches (and ultimately, his stroke). This was found a little too late and he was put on hospice. We expected to have a few months, but it turned out we only had a few weeks. I wasn‚Äôt present as I could have been because I thought I had time.

I wish I took more time to listen and advocate for him. I am so angry because many of the doctors involved just saw a disabled man, and assumed that he didn‚Äôt need a high level of investigation because he had a ‚Äúlow quality of life‚Äù so it wasn‚Äôt worth their time. He was worth so much. Even when he could barely walk he would move around his yard in his wheelchair to plant flowers with one arm because he just wanted to make his neighborhood a little more beautiful. He loved people so intensely and so openly. He wasn‚Äôt perfect, but he was just a very good person.

I know things could have still turned out less than perfect if the circumstances were different, but I can‚Äôt help but think if a little more time and effort went into his care, he may have had a bit longer.

In an effort to give back to those that have helped me I have filed for a non profit organization that I am calling the ‚ÄúFriends of Minds‚Äù foundation.  I am still about 10 weeks at least away from a decision from the IRS so I am not asking for donations.

The  vision is to connect people that have experience with a brain injury with people who get new brain injuries so that the journey doesn‚Äôt feel so lonely. Kind of like an AA for brain injuries but without the anonymity.

I am reaching out to anyone here that has a brain injury that would either like to receive help or perhaps provide help to someone with a new brain injury.  I would also like to point out that even though you may think you are not where you want to be in your recovery you still possess invaluable insight into what it‚Äôs like to have a brain injury.

107,It's awesome something like this subreddit exists,23,a0vyrf,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/a0vyrf/its_awesome_something_like_this_subreddit_exists/,3,"I had no idea of this subreddit till just now and felt compelled to post. Of course a supportive group for stroke victims or family of stroke victims is on reddit! Way to go reddit! You're awesome. 

Anyway, I'm a family member of a stroke victim. To make a long story somewhat short, my mom had a minor stroke three years ago and then two years ago she had a major stroke. She's completely paralyzed. The most she can do is move her left hand and she's right-handed. She can't talk or eat on her own. 

My mom was being taken care of by her sister since she was living with her sister when the stroke happened. My aunt is not a nurse but she learned the basics and got help three times a week where an actual nurse came. 

My aunt has a history with drug abuse specifically meth addiction and has been sober and relapsed a handful of times. 

I'm married to someone in the military and the military moved us overseas. I put a lot of trust in my aunt to continue to take care of my mom. Before I saw my mom as often as I could, on her birthday and holidays like Christmas since we lived in separate states. Now I haven't seen my mom since August 2017. 

I got pregnant with my son in October 2017. I asked my aunt to tell my mom and as far as I knew she told her but I didn't know I was having a boy yet. 

In April 2018 my aunt relapsed and stopped taking care of my mom. There were signs of not only neglect but abuse as well. My aunt was arrested. My mom was taken to a hospital to assess further damage and then she was put into long term care. 

It's been really difficult to be dealing with this when I'm so far away. I'm also an only child so the burden is put on my shoulders. I've been in charge of signing consent orders on her behalf since I'm her only next of kin. 

It's also hard not being able to just call her and talk to her. I don't even know if she knows I had my baby. Or what her grandsons name is. I know no one has visited her since I gave birth to him. When we are able to fly back to the states for a visit I'll definitely visit her. But it's just been very emotionally challenging dealing with these changes and being far away. I think of my mom every day  but theres a part of me that has emotionally shut down because one of my biggest fears is getting a phone call saying my mom has passed and I wasn't able to see her one last time. I think it's easier on me mentally if I block it out and don't think about it or talk about it. I have friends and family ask how my mom is and I just shrug because I don't know how to answer. And I don't want to tell them either when they could easily go see her and find out for themselves. 

So I'm glad I found this subreddit so I can vent and might actually talk to someone who knows how I feel.

108,Update: My dad (66; hemorrhagic stroke) had left-side movement this weekend!,24,qkiwld,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/qkiwld/update_my_dad_66_hemorrhagic_stroke_had_leftside/,8,"So, a few weeks ago I posted about how my dad had a hemorrhagic stroke on the early morning of September 24. He spent 9 days in ICU (had surgery for his brain bleed on the fourth day), another week or so in a step-down at the hospital and for the last 3 1/2 weeks at an inpatient rehab program.

He's able to speak no problem, feed himself, move his right side, and has pretty much all of his memory (some short-term things here and there like introducing us to nurses, etc. but not too bad) but was completely paralyzed on his left side.

That thankfully changed on Saturday when my fiancee and I were working on some exercises with him and he was able to kick up his left foot 4-5 inches on command. In total on Saturday, he kicked it up about 40 or so times (we did 4 sets of 10). They've been hoisting him into a wheelchair the past few days and getting him out into the activities room, which looks to have improved his blood circulation and overall movement as well. I imagine laying in a bed 24/7 makes it very difficult especially when all the blood leaves the leg.

Although small, it was such an amazing thing to see and we made sure to show a LOT of encouragement to him about this milestone. He did the same thing on Sunday, and this time my mom was able to see his foot movement as well. When he was placed back in bed Sunday afternoon, he was able to shake his leg on command and we told him he needs to keep working on this every day even when he's not in therapy. 

I'm not sure exactly where to go from here, but I will for sure be pushing him this week to keep working on his left leg, foot and arm (still no movement, but he's working on it). I also want to make sure the therapist knows of this development and that they continue working on him getting more movement.

I know my dad will eventually have to go back in for surgery to place the skull bone back in and that will take some time for the sedatives to wear off and for him to recover from that, but I just wanted to share and see if anyone had anything to add.

Post-stroke fatigue (or neurofatigue) is common, and it‚Äôs hard to predict whether it will completely go away. Neurofatigue has been described as ""brain fog,"" like walking through Jello, or complete exhaustion with little output. It can be incredibly frustrating.

Using energy conservation and activity pacing strategies can make it easier to do things you want and need to do. These strategies are not a quick fix. But by doing a little planning, you can still accomplish a lot! Use the 4 P's to remember these strategies:

1. **Prioritize:** Think about the activities that you need or want to do. Start with the most important and put off less important things if you have to.
2. **Plan:** Plan your day to avoid extra trips. Plan for the week so you can give yourself rest days. Try to get a good night's rest.
3. **Pace:** Slow and steady wins the race. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to rush to get things done. Take rest breaks when you need them. Ask for help if you need it.
4. **Position:** Sitting uses a lot less energy than standing. Sit for tasks when you can.",2021-05-10 13:49:44+00:00,"['OMG yes. This is my worst symptom.

The most important thing right now is that your Dad gets as much attention and therapy as possible while he is an in-patient. Early recovery IS easier and gains now would take much more effort later.  Listen to the doctors but your family has to go to bat for your Dad and insist they do everything possible as these early days are very important.   After the early days, your Dad will transition to outpatient care. The intensity of care will decrease and it's likely that the rate of recovery will also decrease.    This is not because he can't recover but is more because the rate or intensity of recovery efforts have decreased.  Ultimately, he will be transferred to outpatient care which is much less therapy.  I hope your Dad recovered fully before this but, if not, the rate of recovery goes down .. a lot.

123,Ive had 4 strokes within 3 years and am alive and walking and talking. Looking for positive feedback that i still have a long life/future ahead of me,23,mqvtpx,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/mqvtpx/ive_had_4_strokes_within_3_years_and_am_alive_and/,18,"Sorry about the length of this.  Im going to be very transparent because i want to at least prevent one person from doing the same as i did.  For 8 plus years ive used steroids and drank and partied etc.  I just got back from rehab november of 2018 and had my first stroke on November 17 2018.  It was an occipital bilateral infarction on both sides of my brain.  For two weeks i was getting bad migranes and didnt think anything of it until friday the 16th i got vertigo.  Woke up the next morning and could barely see out of my right eye.  It usually only occurs for 30min of blurry vision but this had been since the night before.  So had my cousin take me to the hospital and i had a stroke.  Not 2 weeks later i was back to normal and no deficits i was very lucky.  I continued to take steroids and drink like i was invincible.  

   Fast forward, june 2019 i was on the way to work when i was on the phone with a friend and felt like i was about to passout, i asked him to call 911 because i thought i was dying and called my girlfriend and mom to tell them i love them. luckily I wasnt dying it was another stroke that induced vertigo i was actually released the same day.  After the vertigo subsided i felt like nothing happened.  Again i was very lucky and continued to do steroids and drink and part like an idiot.  

&#x200B;

   I had my 3rd and biggest stroke over a  year later on september 8th.  For the first time i was really scared i was in ICU for 2 days the swelling from the stroke was by my cerebellum and almost killed me.  I could barely walk or use my right hand and speach was slurred.  Luckily that all came back but my speech is still bad.  I had a doctor who was real with me and i was scared to death i said i will stop everything if you just help me and lead me down the right path.  So i told him what i was doing and he thought the steroids and life i was living was the cause for sure so he took me off blood thinners as long as i stopped doing what i was doing.  So i did that, stopped the steroids, havent had a sip of alcohol or gone out etc. On november 11th i had my 4th stroke, it was small but i went in thinking it was anxiety come to find out it was another stroke.  So since then theyve had me on Warfarin and aspirin and ive been fine.

  My biggest concern is my anxiety is worse than ever, bad headaches occasionally and dizzy.  However my symptoms are finally getting better.  But i just want to feel normal again, and my biggest question is ive given up so much can i truly live a LONG life still doing the right things and with the health plan im on?  Im very lucky to be alive yet walking and talking. i am 30 years old and want to live until an old age.

They determined that my vessels are more narrow than they should be. Congenital they said. So now I‚Äôm on Brilenta for life. Taking me off blood thinners caused the 2nd stroke. I changed my life immediately as well. Quit smoking cigarettes day of 1st stroke. Quit the weed after the 2nd stroke. I still drink in moderation.

I had 3 strokes within the span of a week (2 in my cerebellum, 1 in my occipital lobe).  They still can't pinpoint a cause but one of the possible culprits was medical marijuana (it causes vasoconstriction, narrowing the blood vessels in your brain).  I stopped the marijuana immediately and I haven't had any more strokes, but I was left with a few deficits.  I have severe vertigo, and take meclizine around the clock to keep it under control.  I was told I have to take a baby aspirin every day for the rest of my life.  I suffer from terrible sensory overload now and I have to wear headphones when out in public to avoid panic attacks.

I miss out on a lot of video games and shows now due to the vertigo, but I've discovered a passion for piano.  I met a man who means the world to me, who probably wouldn't have been interested in me pre-stroke.  I've become much more compassionate.  I've started writing a book on my experience.  I am thankful to be alive, and I understand how precious the gift of life is now.  I don't let opportunities pass me by nearly as much as I used to.\n\nSounds like you learned a valuable lesson.

130,My Stroke Story (21M),20,pz4h1y,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/pz4h1y/my_stroke_story_21m/,26,"Sorry for my grammar I'm still a little off since the stroke. Waking up in the ICU dazed and confused on why you're trapped in this room. You can't move and you can't scream. You know something's wrong but you can't comprehend anything but pain.

You lay there with tears in your eyes and pain in a voice you can never speak, just wondering to yourself where did everything go wrong? Why am I broken? Why am I in this godforsaken room? Did I deserve this? I probably did because I'm a fucking bastard. You hear this faint almost incoherent voice, telling your family that you might not fully recover and you might be bedridden in this close to an almost vegetative state, you want to yell and tell them you're ok and that it's nothing, but the words won't come out and you don't even know what the fuck is happening, and that the darkness of the world of pain and torment begin to take over.

It's been three days and you're moving and grumbling, a mess of a man. You finally learn that you had an AVM that finally burst and caused a hemorrhagic stroke. That you're lucky that it happened when you were young, but to be truly lucky is for it to not even burst. You feel you're whole life the world was out to get you, and even your fucking brain tried to kill you. Nurses and even your family force you to eat, nothing stays down and you just constantly vomit all over yourself like a child. You're unable to use utensils because the stroke damaged both sides of your brain. With all the vomiting you managed to lose 40 pounds in the month you were in the ICU. You almost died choking on your vomit, because of being transferred to a different wing you were required to wear a mask. You started throwing up, but the vomit is trapped behind the confines of your mask and you're too weak to even remove the mask and flip yourself over. Lucky for you a nurse sees you shaking and she saves your life.

The constant state of being in pain or drugged off your mind is slowly killing your sanity. You start seeing hallucinations on the fifth day, these shadows with no face or no form like phantoms and death himself waiting for you to die. The hallucinations that scare you the most are the ones of the girl you love dead; no life in her beautiful brown doe eyes, her bronze skin now pale, and her smile that tells you everything is going to be ok is now empty. The one hallucination that fucks you is your childhood abuser ready to violate you again, you can feel their presence and you can feel everything. You're in a world with 7 billion people but somehow you're alone lost in the ocean of sorrow.

It's been a month and you'd been transferred to stroke rehab, it's a great place with amazing staff, but it's humiliating; you fell twice in the ICU so now you're a fall risk who can't leave his bed unless it's supervised or you're going to one of the therapies. Every time you dress you are watched by a nurse, every bathroom visit, and the most damaging to you every shower you have to be watched. You used to play the guitar and piano, you had elegant and swift fingers that played beautiful melodies, after talking to multiple doctors, you learn that maybe you might not fully recover your fingers or even worse unable to play the instruments that you spent forever to learn and that made you so happy.  You think to yourself that you deserved it. Life wanted you miserable and alone, and you challenged life and well life almost killed you with a stroke to humble yourself. The hallucinations are starting to taper off but you still have them and even to this day when your brain is overwhelmed.

The PTSD makes it almost impossible to sleep in any room, my brain just associates any small confined place with a bed as ""ICU"" I learned to accept that I will get vivid and horrid hallucinations from time to time. The one I never learned about was the joint pain, every day my body aches and burns like a fire, it's hard to even move most days.

They thought he had a seizure but were unsure. This morning an MRI was done, we found out that my dad‚Äôs stroke had spread more to the pins of his brain and one side of his brain. He now lost his vision and is paralyzed on his whole right side. The doctors can no longer do anything for him. He‚Äôs breathing 40% and the machine is doing the other 60%. His nerves are broken so he can‚Äôt breathe properly. If they take off the machine, he won‚Äôt be awake to breathe for himself.

My head hurts. I feel numb and jittery. The last time I've seen my sad was two years ago at my wedding. My dad hasn't even met my two daughters and my unborn baby. The last time I spoke to him was last month to thank him for sending me some dry pepper that he grind because he knows it was my favorite. 

Guys, my heart...

The night before my dad went unconscious my sister dreamt that my dad had come to her and said he feels better and that he's saying goodbye. He hugged my sister. 

Anyways, thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post.

He fought hard but he took his last breath in my brother‚Äôs arms on Thursday evening. He opened his eyes and took one last glance of Earth.

Neuroplasticity is one of my favorite topics. Not only because I get to nerd out about neuroscience-y stuff, but it's a huge reason that recovery takes place after someone has a brain injury!

So what is neuroplasticity?  
‚Äã  
Imagine that a person is taking the train to work and has to switch trains twice on their route.

But today, they find that the second train is out of commission and this person has to find a new train route that will take them to work.

Instead of panicking, they look at a map of the train system. They realize there are multiple routes they could take and try one out today.

It goes well and they try a different route the next day until they find one that works well for them.

After a stroke, the injured area of the brain is like that out-of-commission train car.

**Neuroplasticity is the map** we use to try and find other existing routes to get to a destination. Those new routes are established through motor learning by **being actively involved in recovery and repetition.**

136,OT Tip: A is for...,22,n3w3o9,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n3w3o9/ot_tip_a_is_for/,0,"As you may know, May is National Stroke Awareness Month in the United States (where I'm located). I made and shared a video last week explaining [what a stroke is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JW6Q3oIkc8&t=3s). This is the first in a ""Basics of Stroke"" video series I'm currently working on for Stroke Awareness Month.

On social media, I'll be going through the ABCs of stroke to raise awareness as well.  

Let's start with ""A!""

**A is for aneurysm & arteriovenous malformation.**

A brain **aneurysm** is a weakened blood vessel that ends up bulging and sometimes ruptures, which can lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. The American Heart Association notes that aneurysms develop over time and are more common in people over 40. They often develop due to high blood pressure.

Aneurysms grow slowly and weaken as they enlarge. It‚Äôs unknown how to predict when or if they will rupture. High blood pressure can weaken arteries, and straining can increase blood pressure.

An **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)** is something that people are usually born with. They occur in less than 1% of the population, according to Harvard Health. An AVM consists of an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins.

* **Arteries** bring blood that is rich in oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body.
* **Veins** transport the blood that has delivered the oxygen (and now needs to be oxygenated) back to the heart.
* **Capillaries** are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins. They also exchange nutrients from the blood to surrounding tissues.

An AVM changes and disrupts this natural process. It connects arteries directly to veins and completely bypasses capillaries. These fragile, tangled vessels can become damaged over time. This can lead to blood vessel rupture and resulting hemorrhage.

138,Stroke at 22 (my story I guess lol),22,jrqyh1,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/jrqyh1/stroke_at_22_my_story_i_guess_lol/,18,"Hey all, I just created an account and I wanted to share my story since other's stories were so helpful for me when I was in the thick of everything. Last year at age 22, I had a right vertebral artery dissection, which formed a clot that went to my occipital lobe. I have upper left quadrantanopia as a result, which is field of vision blindness from the 9-12 hours on a clock face. 

So it began in March of 2019, when I went on a college spring break/study abroad trip to Hong Kong nearing the end of my senior year. The weeks leading up to the trip were incredibly stressful and I wasn't sleeping well, and feeling sore all over. On the plane there, I began to have massive headaches and desperately felt like I needed to crack my neck. In retrospect, I believe that the arterial tear was caused by my excessive straining to crack it, but sometimes there are just no real answers. Anyways, the trip continues, and I'm nauseous and laying in bed the majority of the time. I did some tourist things reluctantly, and even had a few clubbing nights, but I couldn't think clearly enough to work on the school project or function well. Around a day or two into the weeklong trip, my vision clouded/darkened/fuzzed/shimmered, kind of like if you were looking through an oil spill into the sky. I assumed that the 12 hour time zone change and the general feelings of sickness had caused me to have migraines with aura for the first time ever. I never considered going to the doctor's given that I was in completely foreign country.

The headaches didn't stop once I flew back to the states. I began to worry, and started visiting doctors after a few days. Between urgent care, the ER, and a primary visit, it took three or four tries before my primary physician suspected something was seriously wrong (because of my missing vision). She suspected a tumor, and an ophthalmologist did a field of vision test confirming loss of the upper left quadrant. At the end of April, a day before I graduated college, I had a cerebral angiogram through my groin, which found a narrowed right vertebral artery, indicating a healing vertebral dissection.

That summer/fall/winter was really tough, mentally. The physical recovery itself took time, like a few months, and I was confused, tired, and groggy all the time. I moved in with my boyfriend post-graduation and continued to work \~10 hours a week at a food shop, but I really was just waiting for the end. I gave up on everything, quit working towards a future, and lost all motivation. I withdrew from friends who had all left town to start jobs anyways, and I really tried to rely exclusively on myself and the internet for help. I sunk into a really deep place. My bf and I broke up in November 2019, in part (but not entirely) because of the strain of my dependency and depression. 

A week after that, I had a suspected TIA and spent a week in the hospital while they ran all kinds of tests, with no conclusions. Looking back I think I may have just had an anxiety attack, but that kinda happens a lot now and I'd rather be cautious. 

Upon release, I started an internship in a new city but still moped around. The pandemic hit, lost my internship, I moved home, got a job working at Walmart as a stocker in May. I started working on myself and trying to get mentally better through the summer. As of October I began a new internship remotely, and as of this month (November 2020) I quit working at Walmart to move to NYC.

To say this has all been a challenge would be an understatement. My stroke derailed everything I had going for me, and I'm only just feeling like I'm getting back on my feet. However, I'm really thankful I don't have more serious physical ailments from the stroke. I've done an incredible amount of personal growth, and I'm in a more emotionally secure spot than I ever have been. My blindness is something that ""bothers"" me daily, but I try to keep a good perspective on things, and it feels like my life is on a forward path again now, 1.5 years post the-big-one. My advice to others who are going through this, especially if you're young like I am, is to be vulnerable about it with your friends and family even though they can't/won't understand, and to get professional help about your feelings. I can't advise on more physical recovery aspects, but I have learned that I just personally need to have patience that things will improve over time. I've thrown myself into my hobbies and interests, made new friends, moved cities, and generally tried to grow as a person since the beginning of this year even despite the pandemic, and I think that's made all the difference.

He had his stroke in the October of 2017 and only the right side of his body has been in that state ever since. My family and I have been trying our best to convince him to exercise and he just doesn't want to. Whenever we attempt to open his left hand, he would scream and yell and tell us stuff like 'get lost' and 'fuck off'. It gets so bad that he even bites people my arms have scars from the nasty bites he gives me whenever I attempt to clean or exercise his hand. He cannot even help himself get out of bed and always requires the assistance of another to get up and out of bed.

Most doctors have been throwing my father around telling me to go this hospital that hospital, its just infuriating. Doctors have attempted to give him an injection he would attempt to punch them, kick them and even attempt to bite them.

It just breaks my heart to see my dad in this state, its so bad that I feel like crying whenever I see him. I cannot remember how his voice use to sound like before he had a stroke.

I‚Äôm 40 and recovering from two strokes. And definitely had my period of time where I was working through anger. But four years is a long time to be angry or unwilling to work for your recovery. \n\nMy mother who was 69 at the time had a stroke a year before my first stroke. She also has COPD ( was a smoker most of her life) and doesn‚Äôt get around well. I go to her house to take her trash bins out and try and get her to get up and walk but she does not want to. I‚Äôm not going to drag her. I tell her use it or lose it but nothing really helps. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to accept the fact that she will likely have an early death because of this and it hurts. Has me in tears every time I leave her house. \n\nYou can‚Äôt do it for them. They have to want rehabilitation so much that they won‚Äôt stop until results are seen. The other poster may be right in that if he‚Äôs four years in and any improvement is not likely but I don‚Äôt agree with them that you cant help the process along faster by working for it. I do exercises to get my peripheral vision back in my right eye (not as much as I should). Certain things or movements promote blood flow to the area and that may help the brain make more connections. \n\nThey have to want it. If they‚Äôre not willing to work for it then why should you work so hard for it?? Because you love them I know, tough love may be needed. Best of luck to you and your family.', 'I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it‚Äôs awful. \n\nHave you read anything about post-stroke depression? It‚Äôs incredibly common, because strokes can affect the balance of chemicals in the brain. Depression doesn‚Äôt just need to be sadness, it can also manifest as anger, disengagement, and a whole host of other symptoms. Sometimes treating underlying depression helps people engage in treatments and therapies. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry you feel that the doctors are ‚Äúthrowing [him] around‚Äù and sending him to this hospital and that hospital. Is it possible that they‚Äôre trying to help? I.e. that they‚Äôre trying to connect you with different resources to help address your concerns?', 'This is definitely a terrible situation, honestly the only advice I can give is get him into some type of talk therapy. Idk how much he can talk but maybe it could help. But only he can commit to getting better. And him being violent shouldn‚Äôt be condoned.

Good luck to you üôèüèæ', 'I\'m sorry to have to tell you that after 4 years he\'s not going to ""recover"". If he magically had a change in attitude and started to take all good advice and do all the right things and allow all recommended treatments now, he might show some improvement, but there is a window during which the stroke patient has the opportunity to severely recover - and it will be through hard work immediately - and at 4 years, that has long since passed. In other words, he had his chance, and he made sure not to recover when he maybe could have. \n\nNo guarantee that he would have, he might have made no changes, but the chance was there once upon a time. \n\nI firmly recommend you do your best to put him into professional care now. You can\'t have him biting you and you can\'t be his body slave. He needs to be in the hands of trained professionals.', ""If he suffers from severe spasticity following a stroke, there's a very fine line between helping him and assaulting him. His reaction, when You try to open his hand sounds like this causes him a lot of pain. This is quite common following a stroke, and I had it myself in the initial period following my own stroke back in [2013.My](https://2013.My) left hand was cramped shut, and any attempts at forcing it open caused excruciating pains. You really need to know,what You're doing,if forcefully handling a stroke patient against their will. A specialise neuro physical therapist or neurologist, will know, when it is ok, to force the cramped muscles in the opposite direction, than their natural tendency, but when a well-meaning amateur tries to do so, it can easily end up as a violent assault.\n\nYour father is very clearly signalling to you, that you are physically hurting him, and he wants you to stop.\n\nIf You want to help your dad. Stop forcing him, and especially stop physically forcing him to do things, that his body isn't able to do. Instead, get specialists to manage the rehabilitation, instead of well-meaning amateurs causing more damage than good."", 'I am sorry for your loss and share your sadness. He is IMO unlikely to recover much more. Perhaps you should grieve and accept the loss?\n\nIt sounds like your dad is frustrated at the lack of adjustment by others to his present impaired condition. It is not his fault that he needs assistance to get out of bed and all the therapy in the world is unlikely to change this. A stroke kills part of the brain and it may never reconnect. The reconnection is particularly slow after the first few months. IMO rehab people, to an extent, oversell their services and claim that repetition and stimulation somehow cause the brain to reconnect. It does not work this way. I think your brain reconnects or does not at its own pace. We are sort of along for the ride.\n\n**Edit:** 4 year stroke survivor here', 'Bring to a good acupuncture', 'Hey, first and foremost, go take this digital hug, i think you need it from a Stranger around the Globe!\n\nIll try to keep my answer to your question seperated into two parts, one being my professional opinion from my own experience  within neurocare and the other being my experience with my own grandfather who has had a Stroke 2 years before you dad has his and has been cared for by our family day and night since 1 year. The reason i do that is, because both of these need to be viewed with either professional or personal distance by you as to not evoke the Image of there being any one solution.\n\nIf there is a single thing you take from this, that helps  you get through a single day with  him, then thats more than enough.\n\nPost stroke, patients will, like your father, have to Deal with severe impairments in both body and mind. I like to compare neurological damage to dealing with a severe physical injury while at the same time, with a horriblly impairing psychological Disorder. Its just too much to even begin recovery on one side of the issue, as there is always another thing waiting to Kick you Down. Dealing with needing help just getting out of bed? Not easy, but managable with Proper emotional Support or therapy. Doing the same thing but you cant even articulate properly whats going on or your brain just makes you feel miserable no matter what you do, even if  its Progress? Fucking almost impossible. Just taking in what you wrote about your father, if id try to imagine myself in his head, i would be horrified, angry and frustrated, i would probably not act any different. Its like being really drunk until the point where you realize youre really drunk and you fuck shit up and you need Help, and theres nothing you can do about it. You just have to watch and see you friends struggle to get you home safely when you maybe ruined the evening  and theres nothing at all you can do to change that. I imagine your father sometimes feels like that, and just like a drunk Person angrily throwing away the bottle of water you give them, he screams At the people Who want to Help hin recover.\n\nOn a sidenote, like the other commenter pointed out, yes neurological recovery is not something we can force to happen, but its also not something completely out of your control.   Of course, the recovery might be nothing, it might just be moving your hand a little Bit or even more, you cant know. But its less about the therapy itself and more about what it means for him. Even if you just keep trying different things from time to time, it can Show hin that there are things to be changed,  that like the drunk guy he can maybe sober up a little bit, that hes not stagnating in this horrible State for him and you.  But yeah, dont expect too much improvement neuro-wise.\n\nI myself have had frustrating Moments with my grandfather since the day his stroke happened. Hes a Wall, i cant Talk to him about anything expect the weather and his old warstory. Theres so many things would have wanted to talk to him about, wanted him to at least understand what im doing in life and all im looking at is this husk of what he once was when he cant even get up on his own but shouts at me when i Help him. Sometimes i just want to Run away from his random outbursts of confusion and agression because i cant even hug him anymore, he just pushes me away and doesnt understand. Given, he also has developed dementia so the whole recovery part isnt really a thing that we cared about, the sheer Frustration and helplessness is something ive seen before and i deeply hope you can handle this. If there is anything that has helped me sometimes its Distance, Humor and talking. Distance, because i just need breaks from seeing him in this state and because i need to recharge myself to be able and at least try to do something productive with him. Humor, because i cant dig myself out of the emotional State it puts me in when he does something bad all the time. So sometimes when hes angry i just make a bad joke about what he said, no Matter if he understands it, because at least i can laugh about it (and yes its sometimes difficult to not say anything tasteless). However, this is probably just my thing, so just try to find ways to still have some fun with him, eben if its almost impossible.\nAnd lastly talking to others, even though its obvious, is absolutely crucial to not go crazy and still be the Person he needs. Sometimes to vent, sometimes just to tell others the things he doesnt understand anymore, like when i tell him how much he means to me. \n\n\nSorry for the bad English, im on the phone and its not my first language, but if theres anything i can do to Help you Deal with this, just let me know', 'As another stroke survivor with a clenched hand, I have a CNA here at rehab that opens my hand to wash it(a few months ago I had yeast growing in my hand from moisture not being dried out and it‚Äôs fucking painful I started getting OT for it but had to stop due to the pain but I still stretch my fingers on my own like the therapist showed me, one day I would like to go back to crafting, cookin, and cleaning so that‚Äôs my motivatio, maybe he just feels that he doesn‚Äôt have a reason to try to get function back in his hand and that it hurts too much to keep tryin, when the therapist would stretch out my finger and hold the stretch for 15 second, I‚Äôd tell him to stop and smack his hand because he kept going and I was just in so much pai, he‚Äôs going to have to want to do it for himself', 'I‚Äôm with you, my mom has had multiple strokes since January of last year and she just isn‚Äôt the same person since.

148,OT Tip: Spoon Theory + An Announcement,21,mfvz9n,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/mfvz9n/ot_tip_spoon_theory_an_announcement/,9,"After a stroke, your brain is healing. This can lead to neuro fatigue. Neuro fatigue is very different from regular fatigue. It can feel like ""brain fog,"" like you're swimming through a sea of Jello, muscle exhaustion, that you need to sleep but you can't, or that you sleep for hours on end.

You have better days and worse days. You may be tempted to do as much as you can during the times you‚Äôre feeling really good, but this can lead to exhaustion. That fatigue may keep you out of commission for hours or days at a time.

It‚Äôs hard to convey this level of fatigue. It's also difficult to differentiate between regular and neuro fatigue to friends and family. Christine Miserandino, who lives with Lupus, created the [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). She did so to describe what it‚Äôs like living with chronic illness and fatigue. Here's an example of how to apply Christine's Spoon Theory:

You have ten spoons. Each spoon represents the energy you need to do an activity like take a shower, make a meal, go to a doctor‚Äôs appointment, etc. Certain activities may require two or three spoons.

Let's say you use two spoons on a shower in the morning, one spoon on getting dressed, and one spoon for grooming. That means that you‚Äôve already used almost half of your spoons for the day!

The rest of the day will take planning to use your remaining spoons.

You might need to do laundry, see a friend, and make dinner, but seeing a friend will take four spoons, and making dinner will take 2 spoons. This would use up your daily allotment of ten, so laundry doesn‚Äôt get done today. Tomorrow, when you start with ten fresh spoons, you‚Äôll have to plan around using up some of your spoons for laundry. And the cycle continues.

If you deal with neuro-fatigue, it's already frustrating to not finish what you need to do, when you need to it. It can be even more frustrating when those around you don't understand what you're going through.

If you haven't already shared how neuro fatigue impacts you with your loved ones, I challenge you to share sooner rather than later. Sharing will hopefully lessen your frustration and give your loved ones a window into your experiences. Use Christine's Spoon Theory to help you explain.

According to a [2020 Time article](https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2020/5911314/logitech-adaptive-gaming-kit/), there are **46 million gamers in the U.S. living with a disability.** While options for gamers with disabilities have been limited in the past, there are many more choices for inclusive and adaptive gaming today!

X-Box (from Microsoft) partnered with therapists and gamers with disabilities to design their adaptive controller.

It has multiple ports to plug-in adaptive devices like joysticks or switches and provides button remapping to make it work for you.

It includes a variety of switches that can be plugged into the already awesome X-Box Adaptive Controller based on your specific needs.
* ‚Äã[Ben Heck's Single-Handed Playstation 4 Controller](https://www.benheck.com/single-handed-playstation-4-controllers/) ($300) moves all the controls to either the left or right side so that you can play with one hand. Ben builds these controllers by hand and 3D prints the necessary components.
* ‚Äã[Evil Controllers Accessible Controller](https://www.evilcontrollers.com/accessible-controller-creator) for either X-Box One or PS4 is super customizable (Price Varies). I really like these because they don't look different from a typical X-Box or Playstation controller. Not only can you change the look of the controller, but you can also customize it for accessibility based on your needs, including one-handed gaming.

But no list of errors and misdeeds makes you or anyone a bad PERSON. Your Self, my Self and even Donald Trump‚Äôs Self are beyond our ability to judge. Fully accepting yourself makes it easier to change the things you don‚Äôt like about yourself; the critical voice within is silenced and stops distracting us and stealing our time and energy. Accepting others is similar. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it when my sister yells at me and insults me. But she and I are both fallible beings, and I cannot expect her to treat me perfectly. I have no grandiose right to DEMAND that she be different. Now that I accept her as she is, she no longer has the same power over my emotions. I can choose to let her go on, ask that she stop or leave.‚Äù The great insight of CBT is that we can develop an ‚Äúimmune system‚Äù inside our minds to prevent suffering.\nI‚Äôm getting notorious for doing this,  but I recommend a free book available for download on rebtnetwork.com: SHAMELESS HAPPINESS. It is only about 90 pages printed out, but it thoroughly covers the basis of CBT, both theory and practice. It also has some thought exercises to begin guiding you. \nIf SH works for you, find a cognitive-behavioral therapist who can see you at the prices you can afford. Look for books by Dr Albert Ellis and Dr Aaron Beck. Look at some of the other free materials at rebtnetwork.com. Hang out at r/CBT, where we give each other a hand. While you‚Äôre there, scroll down and find a parable I wrote, ‚ÄúThe Parable of GrumpyGrandpa‚Äù. Jesus, the Buddha and peppery old Dr Ellis team up to show the misguided fellow better ways of thinking. I am retired and a night owl, so I am almost always available for a chat.

I only commented once recently but this subreddit was of great help to me in a short space of time.

My uncle was getting ill and no one could figure out why, he went into hospital on the 8th, and on the 9th he had a big stroke while staying there. Turns out he had a TIA stroke a while back, not sure when.

From the 9th onwards he came and went, the stroke had done a lot of damage, he couldn't speak, both sides were difficult to move, the doctors said he would most likely have no chance of recovery. I came to visit him and the one day that he was semi-coherant he had locked eyes with me when I said I'd come back the next day to see him. I felt almost relieved to have that interaction with him.

Sadly though, during the night last night, he had another big stroke, and today while all the family were with him he passed away.

This subreddit gave me peace of mind and helped me feel more informed, and reading stories of rehabilitation and effort gave me strength. Although he's gone, I'm glad he isn't suffering now.

He was not able to talk or move. He could only squeeze his left hand. They were not able to get the clot in his head and said they wouldn\'t try again because it was too dangerous.

I can\'t stop crying and I feel so guilty if I\'m not there with him. I\'ve been with him every day, and called out of work and school. Tuesday I start my midterms and practicals that are not optional to miss so idk if I\'ll be able to see him for 3 days and it KILLS me inside. His wife will be with him so he\'s not alone but I\'m so scared something is going to happen when I can\'t be there.\n\nThis was really for me to let it all out. I feel so lost and hurt idk what to do. I\'ve never experienced something like this with a family member before. I\'m just thankful he\'s at one of the best hospitals and I know he\'s in good care. Idk what to expect for his future though.

163,OT Tip: D is for...,20,n670hr,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n670hr/ot_tip_d_is_for/,22,"**D is for depression.**

Almost [30% of stroke survivors develop post-stroke depression](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000113#:~:text=Depression%20is%20common%20after%20stroke,a%20cumulative%20incidence%20of%2055%25.). For some reason, this is still a relatively new area of study. The American Heart Association published its first scientific statement on post-stroke depression in 2016.

So much of recovery and rehabilitation is focused on the physical, but we‚Äôre not just physical beings.

We are so much more. We are spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and social beings. Focusing too narrowly on the physical aspect of recovery is not enough.

Unfortunately, this often comes down to the survivor to advocate for their own mental health needs. The systems in place, at least in the U.S., still tend to focus on the physical.

So what can you do about it?

**Express yourself.** Let people know (whether it‚Äôs your rehab team, your doctor, your family, your friends) that you are feeling down. People can‚Äôt help you unless they know that you‚Äôre struggling. It‚Äôs not easy to do, especially if you‚Äôre the type of person that doesn‚Äôt like asking for help.

**Reach out.** Ask for help from family or friends, or get booked with a counselor. Don‚Äôt forget that, having survived a stroke, you have also survived trauma. You may go through a [grieving process](https://elysenewland.com/articles/grief-and-acceptance) for your old self, and depression plays an active role in that.

**Understand.** There is absolutely nothing wrong with you for feeling down. In fact, with up to 30% of all stroke survivors experiencing depression, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs unfortunately common. You are not alone.

I‚Äôm 23 and had a ICH stroke in February 21, 2021, most likely due to my Lupus and/or Covid illness in December. I keep being told I‚Äôm lucky because I got my treatment really quickly(I screamed and my family checked in on me before calling 911 and me bing in the ER around around an hour after the pain started). One of the only major side effects still going on is the loss of my right sided vision and everyone keeps saying there‚Äôs a chance it can come back but I‚Äôve struggled with the thought of it not coming back. My right side is weaker than it was before the stroke but it‚Äôs maybe around 85% there. I do have some trouble with memory but am trying to repeat things to myself to help build my memory back a bit. I‚Äôm worried about my future career outlook because the visual thing will be hard to accommodate if I don‚Äôt recover enough to read properly.

**What is it?**

In short, the muscles closest to your body have to be strong and stable before you can regain mobility of the muscles farther away from your body.

To achieve movement in the hand, you have to make sure that your shoulders are strong. While you focus on the movement and strength of the hand, don‚Äôt forget to strengthen your shoulders! 

An easy way to do this is by shrugging your shoulders up to your ears and then pressing them down towards the ground. It‚Äôs an easy and effective exercise you can do anywhere!

175,My moms stroke,19,o6k4u3,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/o6k4u3/my_moms_stroke/,14,"My mom had a massive MCA left stroke which seems to have affected her right side. She‚Äôs also not been able to talk to us. 

After her stroke which happened on a Saturday night at a party. Everyone there seemed to have assumed she was drunk, which was odd because she doesn‚Äôt drink. It didn‚Äôt click for a while to everyone there that she was really bad. And her being out in the country, outside of the city and 30 minutes from the nearest hospital didn‚Äôt make things easy. 

I live out of state from her so when I got the phone call from my sister and it was a ‚Äúmom got really drunk at a party and she‚Äôs in an ambulance headed to the hospital‚Äù. I was pretty upset because my little brother is with her and she needs to be coherent. She was expected to drive him home after too. So i didn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd get drunk. 

I went to sleep that night and just told my sister there to get in touch if anything else changes. 

I woke up early that morning because I got a weird feeling. And I had a bunch of phone calls and texts and one of them was a ‚Äúdude it‚Äôs serious, mom had a massive stroke‚Äù. I immediately called my sister and we both broke down. The kind of stroke she had was really bad. My sister said when she went to meet them at the hospital before they transferred her out to a bigger hospital in the state capital that she wouldn‚Äôt move anymore and just shake. She looked frozen. They told us that they‚Äôd do everything to save her but it was bad. She was too far out of the city and they didn‚Äôt know it was a stroke first. 

I don‚Äôt blame anyone for how they responded. I don‚Äôt think anyone would of known it was a stroke. It broke my heart. My sister and family has been particularly mean to her. They would tell her things and make her cry before hand. My sister would tell her she‚Äôd beat her if it wasn‚Äôt for her kids being around. My mom was set to move out that following week in 3 days. She had signed her lease for her new apartment. She was so excited. She had visited people and talked to them over the phone telling them she was getting her new place and getting out of the abuse‚Ä¶ and now her whole life has changed. 

My family and sister regrets everything. Everyone has changed their minds and things. My dad had my mom blocked for being annoying since they separated. She would constantly be obsessing over him. 

The day she had the stroke my little brother got her phone and texted my dad right away since he lived a few blocks away from the party. And he ignored all of the texts. He didn‚Äôt want anything to do with them. He regrets it now and I tell him not to blame himself. But had he read them he‚Äôd know it‚Äôs my little brother and not my mom messaging him asking for help. He was terrified watching my mom look like she‚Äôs never had. He even messaged me and that‚Äôs how I got confused. He was talking to me asking how I would react when I was too drunk. And trying to give himself reassurance. He got to see her before they sent her out to the other hospital and he was just bawling according to my sister because his own mom couldn‚Äôt talk back to him or look at him. 

I wanted to head out but everyone said things would be fine. Extended family was informed and everyone wanted to go see but with Covid protocols only two people are allowed. Unless she was about to pass we‚Äôd all be let in. 

About 2-3 days in. The swelling was to start. And it did. But given her stroke. Everything they anticipated was worse. She had a heart issue which they still haven‚Äôt been able to figure out. She‚Äôs apparently diabetic and has high blood pressure. Things she‚Äôs gotten checked before and nothing. She didn‚Äôt know. And neither did we. But her brain swelled more than anyone would of thought that she went into a coma. She was dying and that‚Äôs when I got a call telling me they were doing emergency surgery but they don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to make it. She was on a ventilator. Everyone told me to wait and now they told me I had hours. Just hours when I lived in a totally different state. Granted it‚Äôs not far by plane. 2 hours a bit over. Or drive about 20 hours. What was I supposed to do? The plane tickets were over $400 and I only had $200 in my bank. I could only get one the next day. Everything was crumbling. I wanted her to hear me and feel me next to her. We‚Äôve been closer than my other siblings. I‚Äôm her oldest. I thought maybe she‚Äôd want to see me and know I was there with her. 

I made it the day after and they had to cut her skull to make room for her brain to swell up. They weren‚Äôt sure if it would work but it did. When I got there the next day I went from the airport to the hospital. I got made the primary decision maker for her. And she had no hair on her but she was off the ventilator. And on her own. She saw me and somewhat smiled. She gripped my hand with her left working hand. I laid my head down on her lap and she touched my head and scratched my back like she would when I was a child and sick. My mommy was there. 

Months before all this happened she complained of feeling weak and tired. Tingly/numb right arms. I told her she was having stroke like symptoms. To get checked and she did. She went to an ER months back for it because it got worse. They dismissed her claims and told her to go home. No one bothered to care. English isn‚Äôt her first language but I know she explained just like I told her to. And they disregarded her. 

The current place she‚Äôs at which is the same hospital group with the one from our hometown said she had to have had smaller strokes. And this could of been less massive than it was. She won‚Äôt ever have her quality of life back. They told us the part of her brain that seems to have died inside is her speech part. So she will mostlikely never talk again. She still has blood clots inside her brain they cant remove. I‚Äôm wondering if these smaller strokes were the ones that changed her personality a bit. I‚Äôm still working on taking all of this. I am taking FMLA leave from work. I am set to start university back home too. And I‚Äôm working on getting all her documents sorted now. This is all so tough. This is my little rant here. Maybe I need some reassurance or knowledge on what questions to ask.",2021-06-23 19:32:38+00:00,"[""I am so, so sorry you are going through this.

She may grow frustrated with the therapy and want to quit sometimes, but it is really important to continue the therapy during this important period because after a while she will reach a plateau in her progress where she stabilizes; so the more you can do early, the better.  We have been taking care of my dad for 14 years and he is now in his 80's, so your mom can live for a long time if her caregiver(s) make sure she eats a simple healthy diet, does her PT, and takes her medications.

176,OT Tip: M is for...,18,nfaiwp,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nfaiwp/ot_tip_m_is_for/,6,"**M is for mental practice.**

Mental practice, also known as motor imagery, has been used by athletes and musicians for years to sharpen their skills. [Mental practice is effective in stroke rehabilitation](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/strokeaha.114.004313) when combined with traditional rehab activities and exercises.

Essentially, mental practice is the act of imagining yourself doing an activity or exercise without any actual movement. It's been found to cause cortical reorganization (brain changes and adaptation) and improve arm use after stroke.

One of my first blog articles was [Improving Outcomes with Mental Practice](https://elysenewland.com/articles/improve-outcomes-with-mental-practice). In that article, you'll find a video of a mental practice activity to practice along with if you have arm/hand weakness. You'll also find a guide to use with your mental practice activities at home (using [the PETTLEP model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241734567_Perfecting_practice_Applying_the_PETTLEP_model_of_motor_imagery)).",2021-05-18 13:18:58+00:00,"['One of my professors did research on mirror neurons in your brain while imagining yourself swallowing or watching a video of someone swallowing‚Äî your neurons fire as if you‚Äôre doing it!

Or even really discern the letters, which become approximately the size of the point of the pencil I write with. If I go really slowly, the writing stays big. If I don‚Äôt know what letter is coming next, it also stays big. But writing what I want to, when I want to is impossible.\n\nIt used to be that, as I was falling asleep, I‚Äôd envision myself writing words. Or equations. A couple of years post stroke, I finally lost that tendency; now, I write a single word.

It is an existential thing, and you will carry it with you the rest of your life.\n\nI had an ischemic stroke in July last year. And only now - some six months later - am I finally beginning to acknowledge what actually has happened. The first half year I spent basically learning to cope with how my stroke injuries affected my daily activities and find alternative ways of going about them. \n\nI didn\'t really cry or break down a lot during these six months. I was just functioning. Then, at the end of January I just broke down. It hit me broadside. Utterly devastating.\n\nBecause I have been suffering from major depression the past years, I was already seeing a psychotherapist. Post-stroke I continued seeing him, something I am very thankful for as it has helped me immensely - especially the last weeks. \n\nSo - my advice to you would be to get psychotherapy so as to take the brunt of the shock of realizing that you\'ve had a stroke. \n\nIn addition: \n\n\\- Get enough sleep and rest. This is so crucial. Your brain has just had a major accident, and needs time to heal - just like any other wound. I\'ve gone from 4-5 hours a night to 8-10 hours plus 1-2 hour long naps\n\n\\- Take vitamin B-supplements. It is the so-called ""brain-vitamin"" and I was advised to take it by the neurologists at the hospital/stroke-unit where I was treated.\n\n\\- Educate yourself so as to learn and be prepared of what may happen - if possible also your family and friends. There are therapy groups, online groups, youth groups. Personally I didn\'t join any groups as I only had like four to six hours a day where I could function before the headaches became too severe. And I needed those hours for everything else that had to be taken care of and required my brain to function.\n\n\\- If possible, go for walks - short ones, long ones - it doesn\'t really matter just as long as you\'re moving. \n\n\\- Create routines - the little hangers in life. Having a stroke is such a chaotic experience, and routines offer some sense of control. \n\n\\- Keep a journal - if you are so inclined. It can be audio-recordings, photographies/pictures, drawings/paintings, or just writing. Personally I found it a very cathartic exercise the last weeks.  \n\nAnd most importantly:\n\n\\- Be kind and forgiving to yourself. You will have good days and less good days. There is no quick way to heal trauma - just time and patience. A single fire can wipe out an entire forest, but the forest will grow back again. It just takes time.', ""So sad.

182,My Daughter Had a Stroke,19,bluu4e,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/bluu4e/my_daughter_had_a_stroke/,9,"I was thirty days from retirement, enjoying a weekend away at our cabin retreat, the place I called home, comfortable in knowing all was right with the world. Then the phone rang. As it was a Sunday, it was a little odd to get a call at 7:00 a.m. but happened sometimes. When my husband answered, I heard long pauses and tones of concern. Thinking something had happened to my father who was 84, I listened attentively. However, when he used the pronoun ""she"", the alarms went off. Something had happened to one of my babies. By the end of the call, I knew it was Kari, my 33-year-old daughter and mother of two girls. I also knew it was critical because my eavesdropping only deciphered more unknowns; it was life-threatening, occurred suddenly, undefined, unidentified. Kari was in the ICU without the ability to talk or move her right side - without her mother.

Randy and I dressed, piled in the car without bothering to pack anything except our phones. We scooped up our dog, Dagny, determined to find a place to drop her off. We drove down the mountain road as we had done so many times before. Only this time we soared around curves and bends, memorized from extensive navigation the past 25 years. Dagny was handed off to Uncle Ron as his house resided between the cabin and the hospital.

Anybody who has visited a patient in ICU knows it is a traumatic experience to see a loved one hooked up to tubes from numerous body points, feeding into one unit that acts as a brain for what occurs in the body. Having lived this nightmare before with different characters, terror stabbed my heart - not surprise. With my daughter as the protagonist, my breathing became shallow, my heart pounded violently, and my brain seized on worst case scenarios. My bodily functions didn‚Äôt return to normal until many days later, but the stress tapered when my baby looked at us with recognition and smiled. She was in ICU five days, and in the hospital a total of 11 days.

Following doctor‚Äôs recommendations, Kari moved into St. Luke‚Äôs Rehabilitation Hospital for an additional thirty-two days, bringing the total number of days institutionalized to forty-three. During that time, her husband, Dan, and I defiantly sat by her side even though she probably would have appreciated some privacy. Our mission to protect her was unnamed but clear.

Now, six months after the stroke, Kari continues making gains in therapy. Each day reminds us this is a marathon with short-term successes and hurdles. Though obstacles sometimes slow her journey to recovery, no barriers stop her progression. Her actions exhibit determination. Kari doesn‚Äôt talk in terms of what she can accomplish, will achieve, or desires to complete; she simply lives life. She doesn‚Äôt complain or exclaim, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù; she says, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù -allowing me to sleep soundly each night with an excitement to witness the next day‚Äôs accomplishments.

Some of life‚Äôs worst experiences remind me to remain faithful. Faithful to myself, beliefs, and loved ones. People who confront struggles with resolve, purpose, and willpower are my heroes. They have grit.

I‚Äôve been back since January and since I‚Äôve been back my mother has had multiple strokes (big and and small). In the beginning of April she had another stroke while outside cutting some flowers and broke her hip and also fractured a bone in her foot.

Since her hip surgery, my moms cognitive function has severely declined. She‚Äôs usually confused, she has hallucinations, and she‚Äôs completely immobile now and has been since the break. She goes through periods where she‚Äôs able to talk somewhat normally and even sort of hold a conversation but there are other days where she‚Äôs completely out of it and can‚Äôt speak but to repeat the word ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù over and over again.

She‚Äôs been staying in a rehab facility since April after the surgery, they‚Äôve been trying to do physical therapy with her but she usually refuses and fights them (which is not her, she used to be a lovely person and I still see it sometimes), but also it‚Äôs very painful for her because she‚Äôs so stiff after the strokes and being in bed for months.

I just joined but I kind of wanted to ask a strange question, is it okay to ‚Äúmourn‚Äù my father who had a stroke, even though he‚Äôs still alive? 
My father had a stroke a day after his birthday 10 years ago, he survived this stroke but he was impacted very hard, i was very young.
He was in a coma for a month and when he woke up he lost almost all functions. He still stutters when he talks, cannot pronounce some words, needs a scooter chair for long distances, and needs to use a walking stick in the house. I just feel strange for mourning my prior to stroke father, because he‚Äôs alive (which I‚Äôm very grateful for.) I see other stroke survivors fully recovering where they can continue living normal lives, but sadly my father cannot. 
I remember prior to his stroke, him and I would pick berries, we made snow men, we played sports together. I remember my father brushing my hair, and I just miss not being able to do these things with him anymore. 
Although I was young when this massive stroke happened to my father, I still remember him walking, talking, doing activities, I remember him driving and going to work, I remember him being functional I guess. 

I love my father with all my heart, I just miss who he was, but I accept who he is today and even with the changes his stroke has made in him, my love for him will never change. 

I heard his voice prior to his stroke in an old video, and I cried. I just feel strange for mourning my father in a way but he is still alive. That video is what made me make this post.

Just anything to create new memories that are happy. Best of luck to you though!"", 'I miss my former brain! I miss my energy.', ""You're grieving for what he lost. I was already grieving for what my Dad and I lost, even before he passed."", 'Before I was born, my mother was a cardiac intensive care nurse. She saved lives regularly. \n\nMy parents did everything right. They decided when they were at a good point in their careers to take time to have a child. My mother went to Planned Parenthood for lessons in ""how not to"" and ""how to"". They used birth control until they decided they wanted a child. They decided what season they wanted me to be born. They stopped using birth control when they decided they wanted a pregnancy, and they got one. I was born on time when they had planned. I am a Planned Parenthood success story. I never have to doubt if I was wanted. I\'ve seen the paperwork where my mother kept track of everything, which showed that I was planned and wanted and conceived when they wanted to conceive. I was unquestionably planned and wanted and we should have been a happy family.\n\nI remember when I was two, we were going to move out of our apartment into my grandmother\'s house. She sat down on a bench next to a sunny window in my bedroom, took me in her arms, and explained to me in detail when it was going to happen, what was going to happen on the day of the move, and what life would be like after we moved. She cared intensely that the move wouldn\'t upset me, because it would be *different* and I wasn\'t used to different. I cry when I think about it, because this is the only memory I have of the good and kind woman who gave birth to me.\n\nAfter that she went increasingly insane. (I mean clinically insane, schizophrenia diagnosed by a doctor, I don\'t mean just ""she acted weird."") When I was 11 she tried to murder me for the first time, and my father and I moved out. She continued to try to murder me, and tried about 6 times by the time I was 18. (It\'s hard to say how many to count. It was at least 6, maybe as many as 9, depending on whether you count only the times she knew who I was and was trying to murder me personally or whether you also count the times she thought I was somebody else and was trying to murder them and not me or the times when she was definitely trying to murder someone else and I was just there and it\'s unknown if she would have murdered me if she could have or not.) It\'s odd, when your own mother tries to murder you, your first reaction isn\'t ""oh my god, she just tried to murder me"", it\'s ""well that was awful but maybe she didn\'t realize what she was doing"", and the second time there was someone else there so I thought ""maybe she was trying to kill him and I just happened to be there,"" but the third time I was alone and it was unquestionable and it hit me like a ton of bricks that she knew what she was doing and my own mother was deliberately trying to murder me.\n\nWhen I was 18 I moved 350 miles away. She tracked me down, and I saw her then for the last time. I both moved and changed my phone number several times to lose her. She is still alive, but I haven\'t seen her or spoken to her in decades, I very distantly keep track of her through the one aunt who remains in contact with her so the rest of us don\'t have to. When I was 20, she murdered my uncle. She has been in and out of mental hospitals since, but is presently not hospitalized and lives in Camden NJ.\n\nI can\'t mourn her because she is still alive and I have too much anger to care much about her (this is highly simplified, she ruined my life in ways that would take too long to describe here), but I mourn the good woman who gave birth to me and loved me and took me in her arms and lovingly made sure something as simple as moving house wouldn\'t bother me. I mourn the nurse who she was and the lives she could have saved. That woman died in 1975, and the woman who is walking around in her body is not the good woman who gave birth to me, the nurse who saved lives. I am not mourning so much for a person as I am mourning for the lives we were supposed to have lived, that we would undoubtedly have had if not for schizophrenia.', 'thanks for sharing your story, what you\'re doing is perfectly normal. you\'re mourning the loss of who he used to be and that\'s normal. to quote a certain android ""what is grief, if not love persevering""?

It‚Äôs hard in a situation like this because you recognize your dad is still physically there, and to a friend or stranger they may not fully recognize how much of a change this brought to your life. You watched your dad change a lot in a very short period of time. I can only assume that you see him feel frustrated and maybe even depressed as he learns to navigate with his new limitations. Your relationship that was once based around his guidance and nurturing has likely changed as well.

The brain needs to rewire itself from the damage that was done.  That is going to take a long time and there's no set timeline for stroke victims, everyone is different.\n\nMy wife's Uncle suffered a severe stroke and doctors game him <1-2% chance to live a normal life and maybe not live at all.  This was peak covid and hospitals were only allowing people in to essentially say 'goodbye' but no one would say that, you just knew.  At the time we didn't even realize that and when I got home, I couldn't even tell my wife when I realize that was the case.  He was in the ICU for 32 days, most of which was unresponsive.  Many said his quality of life will be little to nothing, some said he wouldn't want to be brought back from it.\n\nThe stroke happened in June and involved surgeries to open his skull to allow for swelling of his brain to occur, otherwise he wouldn't have survived.  After weeks of being in a coma he woke up, he worked in the ICU on small items and eventually was good enough to be transferred and do rehab.  He did minor rehab at first and then worked hard to get through that and moved onto a more intensive rehab.  Come September he came home but required someone to be there with him 24/7 for the first 3 months.  He lives alone so family rotated days bringing food, taking care of things and now he's on his own and literally was driving around in a 5 mile radius per the doctor yesterday. \n\nThe is the short version but the long version was painful, lots of praying, worrying and wondering what he's going through.  \n\nHearing 'he's basically the same' doesn't mean that is bad.  We were hearing in the first few days that things were progressively getting worse and to be honest, the weeks we had of 'he's not changed much' were almost a relief because we were used to hearing things were not staying the same or getting better, but getting worse.  \n\nWe saw swelling in his brain for a long time and until that went down, the recovery didn't seem to truly start.  Once that swelling went down, the brain began to rewire itself but it takes a lot of time.  The brain is a miraculous thing and can recover in certain capacities. \n\nHold onto faith that he will be working as hard as he can to get back to where he was.  He might not be 100% but maybe he works to get close, but time is needed.  It's the hardest part waiting but remind yourself where he was and where he is today and try not to get sad about the improvement being so little over the course of days or even weeks.  \n\nI distinctly remember the 3rd day when a doctor told us that if he was on a scale of 1-10, he would maybe be a 1 on a good day but there haven't been good days and then he began to talk about his quality of life.  We all got other opinions and doctors rotated in and to see where he is today compared to the days after this happened is a real testament to not give up and allow the body/brain time to recover. \n\nMy advice would be to be there for one another, talk about where he was and where he is today.  He's not gotten worse, and that isn't a bad thing and again I would argue that would even be a good thing.  It's going to change the dynamic in the family for a while, maybe forever but be there for one another and encourage one another when it feels like hope is lost.  Keep up a positive attitude as much as you can and share that positive attitude with your Dad. \n\nI'm not trying to give any false hope here, I'm just sharing our story when it comes to having a stroke hit close to home.\n\nI wish your Dad, you and your family luck along this journey and hope for the best."", ""I went through something similar, my father had an ischemic stroke.  It affected him differently, his sight was 99% gone, his memory lasted about a minute and he had a bunch of other cognitive problems along with this.  My father was in the hospital for a month last July, and while he was in there I did nothing but prepare his place for his release and do research on ways to aid and speed up recovery.  My initial research was to find the quickest most effective way to help my dad, what I found was that there is no quick cure all.  Don't get discouraged, recovery takes time, things I found out I could do seem really small but over time they are super effective.  The first thing I would recommend is repetition, repetition, repetition, day in and out for small goals that you create for them that are working towards a larger goal, the more reps the better! I was told all stroke survivors recover the quickest in the first 6 months after a stroke and longer than 6 months there recovery rate starts to slow down.  I cooked good food for my father, we listen to music and I took him for walks and always tried to make him feel happy and to keep working hard.  I found a bunch of research that stated stroke victims who worked out or did some form of physical fitness each day recovered 60% faster, I can't concur this but I did it!  I would give my father a light workout on days his physical therapist was scheduled and a full workout of her design while she was away.  I researched foods that supposedly helped neuroplasticity and regrowing the brain and protecting it, again no idea if it worked but I did it.  I am the only son near my father so I was in charge his care with little help for a long time, I have a brother and sister who live elsewhere and they were not able to come help me for a good 6 months.  From what I read it sounds like your brother is looking after your father and if that's true this can be a really heavy burden for one person,  so my best advice would be to visit whenever you can, not to take over the care completely but to help with some of the work and to make sure your brother is ok and to lift his spirits as much as possible.  Remember not to burn yourself out (can't stress that enough)and to take a break when you can and reach for help when it is there.  I was told the same thing in the first few months, that my father's brain was still swollen and recovery would take some time. about 4 months after being released to me I started to see real progress with him and still now (9 months later) I see slower but continued progress with him.

While different types of bladder and bowel dysfunction can occur post-stroke, incontinence specifically means that you have poor control of your bladder, your bowels, or both.

Just as you may experience weakness or nerve issues in your arm, hand, leg, or foot after a stroke, you may develop similar issues with the muscles and nerves of your pelvic floor that support bladder and bowel functions. There may also be an interruption in the communication between those nerves and the spinal cord or brain.‚ÄãIn my newest article, Managing Bowel and Bladder Problems, I write about the most common types of bowel and bladder problems that survivors experience after stroke, complications, and a range of treatment options.

Just like the topic of [sex after stroke](https://elysenewland.com/articles/sex-after-stroke), it's obvious that bladder and bowel problems are not discussed enough. This is likely because talking about bladder and bowel issues can be embarrassing and uncomfortable. We don't talk about that kind of thing in ""polite society.""

Looking at the percentage of survivors just experiencing incontinence, it's imperative that we talk about the stuff that might be a little embarrassing.

I\'m very direct and used to push back when people just didn\'t get it.  Too burnt out for that now!  I had my stroke at 44, as a fit and healthy and active person who worked in the healing arts.  Despite my miraculous initial recovery and the fact that my disabilities are now invisible, I did suffer a severe stroke and unfixable dissection and almost died.  I got divorced because of my stroke because my ex was living in his own world of magical thinking instead of the realities of stepping up and being more invested in my recovery and strategizing  the day to day and our financial survival, sadly.  I have had enough of that.  For me, there is only before and after stroke.  It helped me calibrate and get clear on the takers and the givers.   I give myself permission to just leave when people are being ignorant.  I tried to recommend books, TEDTalks and hospital post stroke information.  Some people will never get it, will never do the work to understand and won\'t do their own research.  Theoretically when one person in a relationship or family or circle of friends changes, everyone should make adjustments.  I learned the hard way that isn\'t true.  So, if people don\'t or won\'t understand and listen or adjust, I limit interaction with them or just let them leave my life or I cut them off.  I have enough to navigate every single day - neuro fatigue, mental health issues, days when I\'m weak and unproductive and figuring out my financial survival post losing my income and profession and post divorce et al.  Exercising, eating healthy and continuing to pursue new studies and expanding my mind and healing are my focuses.  I don\'t waste my energy talking into a black hole of the selfish and self absorbed, rather I gravitate towards people who are compassionate, understanding and/or who are willing to do THEIR own work around the changes in me.   I don\'t like to give advice, but rather suggestions:  keep the focus on yourself, practice energetic and self preservation and give yourself the space to do all of healing you feel you need and pursue and research all of the therapies, alternative and allopathic, that will help you get stronger.   Enjoy your life as much as you can!  Your chi has taken a hit and you deserve health, beautiful, calming environs and people and unconditional love.  And, let the naysayers go.  It\'s your life and you\'ve been through a lot.  I used to feel 85 years old early on, post stroke and over time as I got stronger I don\'t feel that way most days.   I hope with time you ""de age"" and walk stronger and can speak and write without so much neuro fatigue and can heal your low back pain.  (Acupuncture helped me with that, for sure.)  Rest.  Sleep.

I'd bet that many of you already know what Occupational Therapy (OT) is by now, especially if you or a loved one has been through rehab.

What you may not have known is that OT, as a profession, began in 1917 to help soldiers with injuries returning from World War I.

OT continued to grow and found a home in mental health settings. That's right, our roots are in mental health!

As time has gone on, OT integrated into the physical rehab space as well.

OT has found a way to blend science and art together in order to help people do the things they value. I understand and apply scientific evidence, but never lose sight that *listening* and a person's *experience* are often the most important tools.

Thank you for letting this OT show up in your sub.

196,I [26M] had a stroke and I feel guilty for what it has done to my SO [24F].,18,lujihi,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/lujihi/i_26m_had_a_stroke_and_i_feel_guilty_for_what_it/,12,"I guess this is a vent. I had a stroke at the beginning of last month at 26 years old. I have been in an incredible relationship with my SO.

Every relationship has its issues, and something I really liked about my relationship is that we always seemed to work through any problems in a healthy manner. 

Things have changed since the stroke. We have been living together and since the stroke I feel like I'm holding her back and it's caused alot of tension our relationship and our life.

I was lucky enough to keep my normal functions, but I still do not think it's fair of me to let her take care of me (Im not allowed to drive, I've had to go back to the hospital due to signs of a TIA). 

Three weeks after the stroke, her mom was trying to convince her to break up with me, and that caused a ripple between her parents and I.

Her mom threatened to disown her if she didn't break up with me and move back in with them. 

Before the stroke, we would hang out with her parents alot (her mom is like her best friend). But after the stroke (and the whole disowned thing) that has changed. 

I can tell that she really misses having conversations with her mom. On Friday her mom invited her over for dinner, and every day this weekend she has been back over to her moms place to hang out. 

I just don't feel welcome at her parents place anymore, and they haven't invited me, so I ask her to go without me.

I know she loves hanging out with her mom, and I don't want to be the reason that stops. But I don't feel comfortable staying alone by myself at the house. 

She has suffered alot since the stroke, but at times, its hard for me to see past my own suffering. I dont want to stop her from seeing her family. But at the same time I want to feel safe. 

I've been thinking to myself that it would be easier for me to break things off and live with my parents, but I love her, and this is by far the best relationship I've been in.",2021-02-28 16:09:26+00:00,"[""This requires a sit down convo with your SO. \n\nYou need to tell her everything you said here. I understand your feelings of being a burden because you are no longer the able bodied adult you had been.

Tell her you're worried you're dragging her down or holding her back. \n\nDon't lay the blame on her for these feelings, especially if she's never voiced any discontent. She's probably just as scared and confused as you. So you both need to be open and honest where you stand. She might be too overwhelmed. She probably needs support on how to handle this too. But you need to know if she's with you in sickness and/or health or if she's as flaky as her mom. She could be worried that you're pulling back from the relationship too.\n\nBut I don't think it's fair to either of you to just break it off without an open calm communication of your feelings.

I have for about 5 years, now. I use to visit her twice a month until COVID hit. I haven't seen her in 4 months now. We have a good relationship and I love her so much.

I got a call Monday morning that my Mom was in the ER. They didnt know what happened. She woke up and walked to the kitchen. Just made coffee and then collapsed. 

At first the doctors communicated with me that she was incoherent and could not talk, her right side was paralyzed. Today, I video chatted with her for the 1st time and it was such an emotional experience. She is still unable to talk. She was able to blink her eyes as a form of communication but was very slow to do so. She did attempt to smile twice and I let her know I noticed and I encouraged her. Let her know I love her, everything will be ok, I'm ok...just comfort level stuff. I cant imagine how terrified she might feel.

Later today after the call, her nurse reached out to me. Says she has been more responsive. She actually ate 50% of her puree diet today and that is also better than what she did earlier. I am hoping for the best and I want her to recover but I know this will be a long hard road.

They do not know when she will transition to a rehab. I'm getting with a case worker to help me with my next steps. I'm her POA and basically the only support she does have. I'm thinking of the future, like will she be able to walk again? Will she speak? Will I have to move her in to my house?

Have any words of encouragement? Any thing I should ask the doctors or counselor in particular? Anything I should tell her that is comforting? Share your experiences. Advice. Anything.

Anything will help right now. I'm just glad she seems to be heading in the right direction!

I had maximum of 1 short visit each day since I didn\'t have the energy to handle more and maybe a few short calls with my kids or parents spread out over the day.\n\nI can\'t tell you what to expect since I was ""lucky"" under the circumstances and didn\'t loose the ability to speak.

We have found the following information to answer your question relating to stroke.\n\nWe can only imagine what you must be going through with your mother‚Äôs recent stroke and recovery process. We hope that our findings may be beneficial to you and your mother.\n\nIt appears your mother is experiencing expressive aphasia. Expressive aphasia is the inability to produce language and often occurs when a stroke damages the dominant hemisphere of the brain (Lewis et al., 2017). We acknowledge that speech deficits may be difficult for both your mother and yourself in terms of communication, but here are some ways to enhance communication and encourage improvements with speech. It may help to (1) communicate frequently and meaningfully; (2) allow time for your mother to comprehend and answer; (3) use simple, short sentences; (4) use visual cues or a picture board; (5) structure conversations so that it allows simple answers;  (6) praise her honestly for any improvements with speech; and (7) not push communication if she is tired or upset because aphasia may worsen with fatigue and anxiety (Lewis et al., 2017). It is also beneficial to collaborate with a speech therapist to evaluate her abilities and develop a plan of care to recover her ability to speak and also her ability to eat and advance her diet. In regards to her right-sided paralysis, this requires special attention since mobility and senses/perception are altered. It is common to have impaired spatial discrimination (Lewis et al., 2017). When she is performing activities, such as feeding, it is helpful to control the environment by removing clutter and obstacles and using good lighting to aid in concentration and safe mobility (Lewis et al., 2017). Initially, it may help her to arrange her food on the left side to accommodate the deficits, then later, encourage her to scan the neglected side (Lewis et al., 2017).\n\nWe understand that the recovery process from a stroke not only impacts the affected individual but the family as well. We encourage stroke support groups in facilities or in the community as a helpful source for sharing your experiences and ways to manage, receiving more education, and developing a sense of understanding.\n\nReference:\n\nLewis, S., Bucher, L., Heitkemper, M., Harding, M., & Kwong, J.

Last November my wife had a stroke at the age of 42 together with complications that made temporary removal of parts of her skullcap necessary. After 3 weeks in a coma she woke up and spent 3 Months in the regular hospital for the first rehab phase. 
She was then transferred to a rehab hospital outside our city that was outright awful. They were the most unfriendly and unprofessional bunch of a**holes I ever met in my life. However, from there she was transferred to a long-term rehab facility where she is scheduled to stay for 18 months. And the week she got there she started making progress. 
Yesterday her therapist called me and told me that she was able to walk 7 stairs and that she thinks that it is possible for my wife to come home for a day a t Christmas. Those were the best news I got in the last 6 months and it makes me so happy to think that my daughter and wife might be able to spend Christmas together. 
So for all of you who suffer bad times and may be frustrated or down: better times will be coming and they will feel really really good.

CT scan and MRI done, am told ‚Äúbrain is perfectly normal.‚Äù 12 hours after arrival and well outside any possibility of saving my brain tissue they think I have a virus attacking my inner ear  on RH side. The move me to ward. \n\n36 hours after my stroke the team of neurologists, without talking with me, write down in my MR that I have ‚ÄúConversion Disorder,‚Äù basically my body is making up all these classic stroke symptoms from ‚Äústress.‚Äù Outwardly, because they didn‚Äôt think it was important to talk about this wild theory with the patient, I noticed staff just began getting passive-aggressive and patronizing with me. When my medically educated friends would visit they immediately believed I had a stroke, or at least a TIA. But the young neurologists knew better than them, they believed, and discounted their concerns about the diagnosis. As my body became more and more disabled and pained, their mistreatment and patronizing became even worse. 3 days after my stroke, still without the ability to balance myself, a MSW and young neurologist say at my bedside and tried forcing me to go home, where I lived alone up a flight of stairs. I had a social worker advocate on the phone and she was horrified at these idiots. The MSW even refused to complete the disability paperwork she had started because she said I would be ‚Äúback to work in two weeks.‚Äù Stunning. \n\nTheir immense fuckups and ignorant ego trips caused continual nightmare journey through the American medical system, with all future medical workers relying on their bad notes and getting badly sidetracked and ignorant themselves. After many trips to the emergency room and other facilities and doctors I finally found a competent old geezer neurologist who knew WTF he was doing and he immediately diagnosed it as a RH brainstem stroke without even needing to look at an MRI. But to be sure he ordered an MRI, which confirmed exactly what he said, 2-1/2 painful months too late to do anything. The radiologist also highlighted the stroke on the first MRI that the ER people failed miserably to notice. \n\nSo, they lost me a good job and career, insurance, probably my home, and a shot at a good recovery. Nearly a year later and I still can‚Äôt walk well, not being provided any relevant PT, and just getting fucked around begging for whatever safety net remains in these evil days.

He walks around the neighborhood all the time and seems very well groomed/dressed. I see him in passing and I can tell he wants to talk but can't. He just speaks in grunts or huffs like he's frustrated and can't get a word out.

Everytime he comes by, he stops and checks out my house/stuff from the sidewalk. I usually say hi then try to explain what I'm working on or what landscaping project I want to do next. Can he understand what I'm saying to him? Or I'm I being unintentionally cruel by stressing him out?

I hope things go great with you and your neighbor!', 'They said I had ""a little aphasia.""\n\n**At all times, I could understand everything everyone was saying.** I merely had problems coming up with the right words to say what I meant. I knew the concepts behind what I wanted to say, and I knew words for it existed and I had known them once, but the words, or the correct words, escaped me when I need them. So I might want to say ""turn right at the fork in the road,"" but I can\'t remember ""fork"" and I remember that the directions are ""left"" and ""right"" but I can\'t remember which is which, so it would be ""turn \\*\\*\\* a the \\*\\*\\* in the road"", so I was reduced to pointing and saying ""go there"". (I knew I should say ""please"" but couldn\'t remember the word.)\n\nI was pleased when people took the time to talk to me, but if they felt the need to ask me a question, it was highly frustrating, because I knew what I wanted to say but couldn\'t say it. For the love of god, *don\'t ever* do the ""once for yes, twice for no"" thing. This made me really angry because invariably they\'d tell me ""once for yes and twice for no"" and the truth would be more like ""well maybe sometimes"" or ""not exactly"" or ""something else entirely"" or ""wrong question.""\n\nTry not to ask anything of him directly. Explain that if he wants to interject he may get your attention at any time and you\'ll patiently wait while he finds the words he needs. (Don\'t suggest words to him, that\'ll just throw off his thought process.) Explain to him that if he wants to be elsewhere, he doesn\'t have to stand around with you just to be polite, he can just raise a hand to indicate ""bye"" and go when he wants to. Indicate that if he would like to sit down he can just point at the chair or bench (I hope there is one present) and he\'s welcome to sit, and you\'ll come with him if he doesn\'t shoo you away (either verbally or with his hands). (A person who has had a stroke, maybe aphasia, may be very tired, so standing up may be a bit burdensome to them.) If you have an outdoor chair make clear he\'s welcome to sit in it any time, even if you\'re not there, and if you can, offer him water.\n\nThe key here is to be calm, slowly paced enough that he can think about what you said and keep up, and remember that even though he\'s unable to express himself he\'s still an adult human being so treating him like a child is very inappropriate and will (and should) make him angry.', 'I had a stroke and i also suffered from aphasia, luckily it was temporary.\n\nAphasia comes in different levels, for example in the first few months I had problems to find words but i also had difficulties to remember the meaning of each word and the context of each word in a sentence, something the human brain usually figures out during a conversation, when having aphasia, you forget all these basic ‚Äòrules‚Äô so u somewhat forget the technique of conversating/conversation.

210,Wife is home,17,prbthh,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/prbthh/wife_is_home/,12,"Wife had hemorrhagic Stroke in July this year. It was three days after having her left above knee amputation. To start, she was not responsive on her right side of her body. Had feeding tube. 

I had to really pay attention to how treatment was going forward. After she was out of ICU and a week in a regular hospital room they transferred her to an acute care specialty hospital / long term nursing. 

Right away I observed the staff at this place not doing any neurological testing I observed at the hospital were she was at. None of the nurses preformed and testing in the three days she was there. I was at her bedside 12 hours a day and I did the neurological response I observed the nurses do at the hospital were she had been. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure why it was different at this other place but I also observed they would not put her bed back at the 30 degrees angle she was supposed to be at with the feeding tube. Every time they had to move her (2 hours and bedding changes) they left her at about 10degrees. I would correct that at lifts her back to 30. 

On day three she was becoming less responsive to my testing and was told she was just very sleepy and exhausted. On that third day she was so abnormal in response I insisted the nurses check her. They finally realized she was having problems and a doctor got her in for a CT scan. 

She had edema putting pressure back on her brain and they didn‚Äôt have the ability to treat that so back the the original hospital she went. I insisted back at the hospital she not return to that place. As a result the hospital treated her edema at she returned to being responsive quickly. 

I realized I needed to be absolutely involved in any decision being made going forward. I had to question and understand everything they were doing and wanted to do. Especially with medication. By this time my wife was improving where she could talk and swallow. She could communicate that she had pain but unable to say exactly what it was. I had to be active in understanding her so the staff at the hospital could treat her correctly. 

Long story short, I was able to get her off the feeding tube and get them to stop giving her narcotics. She was then qualified to go to inpatient rehabilitation there at that hospital. She was there for 4 weeks and although her right side was still non functional she has started to regain feeling and some movement with her arm and leg. 

She needs my care 24/7 at home with movement and all other needs. She needs a wheelchair and I work with her twice a day with rehab exercises and medications. This week will be setting up in home PT / OT / Speech therapy. 

One major challenge is going to be getting her into and out of our car to be able to get to outpatient therapy. I can‚Äôt afford wheelchair transportation as insurance doesn‚Äôt cover that.

213,OT Tip: U is for...,17,nmy0re,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nmy0re/ot_tip_u_is_for/,10,"**U is for unilateral spatial neglect (or left neglect).**  
‚Äã  
Unilateral spatial neglect usually occurs after a stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain. It is one of the oddest stroke symptoms. It's a perceptual disorder that causes someone to not pay attention to one side of their body or environment (most often the left side).  
‚Äã  
Functionally, this may look like someone unable to straighten the left side of their glasses; leaving food on half of their plate; or bumping into things in the environment on their left side.

As we know, symptoms of a stroke don't happen in isolation. Survivors often experience multiple symptoms at a time. Neglect can be complicated by visual issues, one-sided weakness, and fatigue.

However, there is a strategy that can help compensate for unilateral spatial neglect: visual scanning. The first step is helping someone recognize they have a neglect issue (this can be challenging). Without awareness of the issue, scanning won't be very helpful.

If someone is aware they have a neglect issue, visual scanning can be a useful tool. You can pretend that your head is like the light in a lighthouse. Try to scan as far left and right as you can to see the whole environment. As with other aspects of stroke recovery, it takes time, repetition, and consistency (re: [neuroplasticity](https://elysenewland.com/articles/neuroplasticity-the-best-stroke-recovery-tool)), and sometimes, it takes other compensatory strategies.",2021-05-28 13:37:27+00:00,"[""Well described.

The outdated view on recovery is that brain changes can only happen in younger individuals or that the brain cannot make new neural connections after a stroke.

***We've learned that this is simply not true.***

While the brain is most adaptable 3-6 months after having a stroke, neuroplasticity (the brain‚Äôs ability to change and mold) lasts a lifetime!

Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that recovery is limited to 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, or even 20 years!

Congrats on your training program, and how wonderful there are people like you who want to help others down this path of recovery."", 'What program did you get into and where is this?', 'This is interesting, can you share the original sources?  Neuroplasticity does last the whole life, however, in most cases there are no significant improvements after the first year. Of course there are some cases that can improve in a significant way later as well, but these seem to be rare in practice. \n\nOften, the problems with over-emphasizing late recover are:   \n1) Spreading false hope. It is not ethical. If the improvement is only seen in ex. 3% of cases, then the rest of the 97% will feel awful for not improving, they will be more stressed etc and this will cause further harm and anxiety, depression, etc.   \n2) Lack of adjustment. This is a real and big problem. The first part is the adjustment to the new condition by the patient. Being a stroke survivor myself, I still refer to the pre-stroke me as the real me and the post-stroke me as a post-stroke me. It\'s been almost 5 years. This attitude does cause psychological problems as well. The second and even bigger part is lack of adjustment by caregivers. At some point, they have to stop hoping that everything will be back to the way it was. Even people who have 100% recovery say that things are never really back to the way it was - they had an experience that influenced the way they see the world and themselves. And with people who don\'t recover 100%, at some point the attention has to be shifted from ""how can I get the fingers of my left hand to move"" to ""how can I live just as good of a life without the fingers of my left hand moving"". The compensation techniques and the use of different aids has to be learnt and practised as well. Often, big adjustments have to be made in the living conditions (ex building a new shower downstairs for the grandmother who cannot go upstairs by herself, so that she could be more independent in her daily life, instead of keeping on with learning to climb the stairs for years and years), the family needs doctors advice for timing such decisions. \n\nSo yes, ofc you should never say that someone cannot improve, but one cannot say that everything will be fine with all the stroke patients that are still wheelchaired 5 years after stroke, if they only try hard enough...']",222

I finally felt like I hit the halfway point on my fatigue recovery about a year after the stroke. Some days will be better than others. You‚Äôve got to listen to what your body is telling you it can do. Also stay hydrated. Take your vitamins. And give it some time.', 'Thank you all so much for the comments!! I really appreciate it and I wish the best for everyone working through their stroke problems too. I will definitely take all the advice seriously because I really want to find a way to make this fatigue better. Currently I‚Äôm taking a baby aspirin a day, 10mg of baclofen (muscle relaxer for bad muscle spasms post stroke) and cymbalta for anxiety and depression after stroke. I know the muscle relaxer may cause drowsiness but I can‚Äôt function without it honestly. I‚Äôm in good shape too but I have trouble exercising due to fatigue. Currently I weigh 127 lbs and am within the healthy range. I was told exercise and a healthy weight would help with my fatigue but it really hasn‚Äôt. Also, my stroke was cryptogenic too so they don‚Äôt know what caused it. My doctors made it seem like that since I was young and my stroke was 8 years ago that I shouldn‚Äôt be experiencing so much fatigue; it‚Äôs just kind of upsetting to be struggling with my job and I wanted to see if anyone else had this issue so thank you all again for the comments. It means a lot.', ""15 months out from a very minor cryptogenic. All functional losses not measurable (their words).\n\nThe first 6 months I was exhausted all the time. I couldn't drink caffeine- I tried, ended up in the ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still tired, but not nearly to that extent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing that may consider, but I would definitely discuss it, is 'modafinil', which is an anti-narcolepsy drug. There is SOME research that indicates it is helpful, however, YMMV. A script isn't that expensive.\n\nThat said, right after the stroke I had some bad reactions to it. It also might have made me more easily upset, but ... let's be honest, I'm only 15 months out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more point that you might not be aware of: sleep study. You might be having sleep apnea and NOT getting enough sleep or oxygen in your brain. Which admittedly will cause all of your symptoms too. So getting a sleep study done or a CPAP machine for 6 to 9 months might alleviate everything. Again, some research..."", ""Like others have said, post-stroke fatigue is very common. Are you on any medications? My sleep/energy levels were all kinds of messed up after my stroke between the stroke itself and the various medications I was on. \n\nGood call on seeing a sleep specialist. I did the same and ended up having pretty severe sleep apnea. I've been on a CPAP machine and it has made a huge difference!"", ""I had a heart attack and six strokes at more or less the same time. \n\nWhen I got home, I had a lot of fatigue. I learned to classify the fatigue into two types.\n\n* Neural fatigue made me feel like my brain was just tired, like I just needed to sleep because I couldn't mentally function any more, but my body felt fine, like my body could go on but my brain just couldn't face the world. I'd go to bed and be out like a light.\n* Cardiac fatigue felt like my body just couldn't continue and needed to sleep, but my head felt fine and I was perfectly ready to be awake if my body didn't need to sleep. I'd go to bed and think about books or music or my to-do list as I drifted off to sleep.\n* Going to bed at night is not fatigue, and tiredness at night is both body and mind.\n\nIn about 6 months my neurologist told me I should probably not be having neural fatigue any more. I told him I still was. It took about a year, and then the neural fatigue went away and I had just cardiac fatigue. Not that that's a cakewalk, but one less thing to face. It has been over 4 years and the cardiac fatigue isn't going away. I'm expecting I will live with it for the rest of my life. I find if I rest up and anticipate it, I can function like a normal person for a while. I feel tired, but I can push through it and act normal... for about 2 weeks. Then my body has *had about enough of this shit*, and I need to start taking a nap in the afternoon again. When I reach the point after a couple weeks that it has to happen, I will feel unusually substantial fatigue and really need to take a nap because I'm rapidly becoming non-functional. I know all this because every year I take a 10 day vacation with family and friends, and because a few years ago I had to go help my father after he had both knees replaced. For the vacations, I go on the vacation and then I come home and sleep for about a full day and then I'm back to my night-of-sleep&nap usual. When I had to go help out dad I rested up carefully for a week prior to going there, then on arrival I was Mr Productive for a couple weeks - preparing all meals, cleaning, driving, helping him around... then, just as he started being more able to stand up and function a little, I started needing naps. His therapist would arrive and I'd go to sleep for an hour while they did therapy, or I'd get him situated in his chair in front of the tv with his knitting and I'd nap for a while. I was there for a couple more weeks and was still doing a lot of stuff, but needed increasing nap time. Finally he declared himself well enough to function on his own, and I went home to a good long sleep.\n\nAt around the same time as the neural fatigue was going away I developed sleep apnea. About 6 months later I got CPAP, which is apparently doing well. That doesn't solve my cardiac fatigue, but it prevents things from getting worse.\n\nI encourage you to both have a sleep test and see a cardiologist for an exam and an EKG. Also if you're not seeing a neurologist who specializes in stroke, make an appointment and see one. At 8 years you probably don't need regular neurologist checkups, but they might be able to help you understand what is going on."", 'This is an incredibly huge problem for me as well and I  feel like my doctors are very dismayed above it as well-even when I explain how it is debilitating to every part of my life. I hope more attention is drawn to this and doctors realize the impact it has on our lives.']",223

I got myself an exception on the visitors banned a few days ago (I know I‚Äôm pushing my luck and increasing the risk) it‚Äôs only been 3 days of me seeing him after more than 2 weeks of not being able but  he tries so hard to be cooperative when I‚Äôm there that I feel I am helping him and perhaps he is a candidate for rehab?

Despite chaos, confusion, fatigue, I think his main job now is to be so charming and hard working that he motivates those around him to give him their best efforts.

She is calmer and has much less dementia-like symptoms. (For example, she stopped becoming hysterical thinking the house was on fire every time the sun shifted and shone on the walls.) Her speech has improved a lot. (Her language center is on the wrong side of her brain, so she got a bonus whammy.) However, she will never be able to move her left arm, walk with a walker, or get her memory back. (I think she now believes I am her daughter, and she had said my name 5 times.) There are much fewer bathroom accidents, but nighttime accidents are still a given. She is still learning how to brush her teeth (thanks to apraxia). \n\nMy life will not be the same, either, but it‚Äôs my new normal.

Movement will come back slowly, she‚Äôll likely regain leg movement first. She may never regain everything back, and overtime you will appreciate whatever she is able to do. \n\nSpeech therapy is incredible. The fact that she has 10+ words right now is a good sign. My dad had nothing immediately after and his vocabulary, while still very very limited now has expanded a bit. \n\nMy suggestions for you: get ready to put up a fight with insurance (if you are in the US!). Start pushing for acute rehabilitation for her now. She‚Äôs young and will likely fall into this category, but start asking any speech/occupational/physical therapists that are coming to see her now about pushing for this. The therapists at this stage will make the recommendation for insurance. \n\nPush to keep her in acute therapy for as long as possible, and part of that is helping her make progress. It‚Äôll be really tough for both you and her, but the more progress she makes the longer she can get 3+ hours of therapy a day.\n\nDon‚Äôt give up on her, on you, your family or even on the healthcare system. Insurance will probably be frustrating, but the doctors, therapists, nurses and cna‚Äôs you will meet and work can be very uplifting and in my experience, made a big impact on my Dad and our entire family. \n\nWhile she is regaining speech you are her advocate. Do you best to use her limited communication with her when possible. \n\nIt‚Äôs a long, slow process. It‚Äôs a hard mindset to shift to (especially in the immediate aftermath), but that anger you feel now will hopefully turn into gratitude for what she is able to do, and gratitude for her life, and that it wasn‚Äôt worse than it was.\n\nEdit: ask social workers in the hospital / rehab where she is now for resources on mental health for YOU. I know therapy for some is a luxury, and I‚Äôm lucky that I was able to pay for it. It made a world of difference and I would highly recommend seeking therapy out, I still go.

**Z is for zen.**

I'm not necessarily talking about the Buddhist practice, although it's great if that's your cup of tea! I'm referring to the more slang form of zen meaning, ""calm and peaceful."" 

Finding ways to relax in daily life and to appropriately respond to stress is so important, especially after a stroke. Stress is our body‚Äôs response to threats. This response causes our ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù system to kick into gear.

In a perfect world, that response would be relatively short-lived and stop once the threat is gone. However, the actual world we live in keeps us in a chronic state of stress, which can lead to elevated blood pressure, high blood glucose, and pain over time.

What can we do about chronic stress?

Vision issues after a stroke are one of the invisible disabilities that don't get enough attention.

There are different types of vision changes that can happen after a stroke including double vision, blurry vision, visual field cuts, eye movement issues, visual processing issues, dry eye, and light sensitivity.

These changes have a significant impact on daily life. They can make watching television, driving, dressing, making a meal, and going back to work difficult.

If you're experiencing visual issues after a stroke, seek out a neuro-optometrist or neuro-ophthalmologist. You can find one close to you by searching [noravisionrehab.org](https://noravisionrehab.org/).

Up to **75% of stroke survivors** will experience executive functioning issues post-stroke.   
Executive functioning is our ability to complete higher-level cognitive tasks like planning, sequencing, organizing, self-monitoring, flexibility in thinking, working memory, and regulating emotions.

Unfortunately, there's not been a lot of research done on cognitive rehabilitation after stroke.   
We need more high-quality studies before we can say how effective this approach is. 

However, you can try something called Drill and Practice. In this method to improve executive function, you break down a task (for example, making a sandwich) and figure out all the steps needed to complete it (gather ingredients and silverware, lay the bread on a plate, place the ingredients, put the bread together). Then you practice the steps in order, over and over, until it becomes more automatic. 

There is better research around using compensatory strategies for executive functioning.  
Some of these include using devices, apps, or gadgets for reminders, or to keep your attention on something. Other strategies include the use of external cues (like post-its, signs, etc.) in your home.

In the medical world, a stroke is known as a Cerebrovascular Accident or CVA. It has Latin origins. Cerebral = ‚ÄúBrain or skull.‚ÄùVascular = ‚ÄúOf vessels or tubes.‚Äù

When we put them together,  a CVA is basically an unanticipated injury (accident) that happens within the vessels (vascular) of our brain (cerebral).

**Some Stats:**

* 795,000 Americans have a stroke each year.
* A stroke happens every 40 seconds in the U.S.
* The risk of black Americans having a stroke is nearly twice as high as white Americans.
* In 2009, 34% of people hospitalized for stroke were under the age of 65.

**The Good News:**

According to the CDC, **up to 80% of strokes** in the U.S. are **preventable** with lifestyle changes. And if you‚Äôve already had a stroke, lifestyle changes can help reduce your risk of having a secondary stroke.

One of the stages of grief is anger.  
Finding ways to constructively deal with anger and frustration will not only be better for those around you, but it can also help you therapeutically work on those emotions.  


1. **Punch.** Sometimes you just need to be able to release your aggression. To do this without hurting anyone else or yourself, use a pillow or some type of makeshift punching bag. Let the pillow have it. You can even punch the air until your arms get tired.
2. **Exercise.** When you're frustrated, your feelings can get pent up. Doing some type of physical activity will use up some of that excess energy as well as release endorphins and dopamine, which may make you feel better
3. **Share.** Share how you're feeling with someone you love. Explain how the anger and frustration you feel are affecting your daily life.
4. **Create.** Sometimes pouring your emotions into a creative outlet can lead to a release and feelings of relief. It can also provide you with a way to more objectively think about and view your emotions.

This has been on my mind recently because my mom has had significant issues getting her needs met by her doctor.

Why? Because the doctor didn't *listen* to what my mom tried to explain to him. There was also a complete lack of follow-up for months in which we were left in the dark about what was supposed to come next. It was incredibly frustrating: so much so that I offered to call the doctor and express that frustration. (She wouldn't allow it).

We're taught from an early age that ""the doctor knows best,"" or for that matter, any healthcare professional: nurses, physician's assistants, therapists, etc.

My fellow healthcare professionals may not like me saying this, but that's not true.

Healthcare professionals are indeed professionals and experts at what they do. I don't want to diminish that.

However, *you* are the expert on *yourself.* You know when something isn't quite right. You know your own body and mind better than anyone else. You also have the right to question any treatment that a therapist, physician, or nurse asks you to do.

Healthcare should be a collaborative effort. Your healthcare team should work with you and *listen* to you. Sometimes that requires that you repeat yourself or ask lots of questions. Sometimes it requires that you seek out another clinician.

251,Looking for advice and support. I had two silent ischemic strokes at 28 yo. They weren‚Äôt discovered until an (estimated) 6 months later because my providers didn‚Äôt take me seriously. Nothing much was done for me and nobody has been too bothered to find answers.

I need advice on how to find better care and get answers for why this happened so I can move on. 

This is partial venting so it will be long, I‚Äôm sorry. In summer of 2019 I started experiencing what I thought were extreme migraines daily. They were accompanied with a constant feeling of being ‚Äúhungover‚Äù with nausea, dizziness, coordination and memory issues. 

I went to my primary care doctor a week or two later who stated it sounded like a case of vertigo that usually goes away on its own, ordered blood work, said it looked normal, suggested OTC pain killers and wrote me off. 

A few weeks(?) go by with the same symptoms until I woke up one morning with a small area of vision loss in my right eye. I went back to my doctor once again who finally referred me to an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. 

Ophthalmologist discovered damage to my retina with no known cause, but stated the damage was small and not much can be done unless it worsens. To this day I have no idea if that‚Äôs even related to the strokes, but now I just assume.

Neurologist also thought I was having severe migraines, and prescribed me migraine medication. He also decided to have an MRI done, ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù It took over a week for my insurance to approve my MRI and over another week for my neuro to call me to go in and talk about my results. He told me I had two small ischemic strokes, said I‚Äôm the youngest patient he‚Äôs ever seen with one, and prescribed me a statin and baby aspirin. He just kind of, left it at that?? Scheduled a follow up to check on my symptoms and also sent me on my way. 

To top things off, while I waited for my neurology results I started experiencing cardio symptoms and trouble breathing fully. I mentioned it to my neuro when we discussed my strokes and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably not related‚Äù and moved on. 

So back I went to my primary care doctor when my new heart and breathing symptoms didn‚Äôt go away. She sent me to a cardiologist from there who ran several tests, couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me, and again I was written off and told to make another appointment if things get worse. 

All of these things outlined happened between August 2019 and February 2020. I intended to go back to my doctor and ask to be referred elsewhere for second opinions, but then covid hit and given my symptoms I‚Äôve been terrified to step foot in medical offices. Now having had time to think about it and research a bit, I‚Äôve decided I want a new primary care doctor and new referrals. 

Once I am vaccinated and feel safe again, I‚Äôm going to begin a search to find good care. Has anyone else had an issue being taken seriously? Is this just the norm? What can I do to find a doctor that is genuinely going to care for me and help me find answers?

I would really appreciate any and all advice or information. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)

A statin lowers your cholesterol and *may* help reduce your risk; aspirin thins your blood, but not very well. At a minimum you should be taking Plavix (which doesn‚Äôt increase your bleeding risk ‚Äî just makes it harder to stop once you start, and doesn‚Äôt require any monthly blood tests or dancing around your consumption of green vegetables), but drugs like Warfarin are also acceptable (Warfarin DOES increase your bleeding risk, does require monthly pricks, and does require you to maintain a very constant consumption of green veggies).\n\nSecond of all, when you‚Äôre in the hospital for a stroke you‚Äôve generally given a bunch of tests to determine WHY you had them. They‚Äôll ultrasound the arteries going up your neck to look for damage. They‚Äôll give you a transesophogeal echocardiogram (TEE), which is when they stick a camera down your throat to look for holes in your heart. They‚Äôll give you a transcranial Doppler (TCD), which is where they squirt bubbles into an IV in your arm and listen to your brain to see if any of the bubbles migrate up there. Both of the last two tests look for a patent foramen ovale (PFO), or hole in your heart. (I was apparently the first in the country to be diagnosed with a PFO that showed up on the TCD but not the TEE. I don‚Äôt know a lot about how it‚Äôs diagnosed now, but from my understanding they do routinely do both tests in the hospital.) They‚Äôll do a battery of tests to look for hypercoagulable diseases. \n\nYou may also benefit from some therapy. My speech therapist was wonderful at helping me develop memory strategies, for example; my occupational therapist helped me with my handwriting (though not very much), and my physical therapist helped me get back in shape. Ask your new doctor (please see below paragraph) for a recommendation/referral.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry that you were misdiagnosed. I beg of you to demand ‚Äúthe full treatment‚Äù from your doctors; for me, this meant finding doctors in the big city. You want to know what caused this, because you do not want it to ever happen again. Trust me ‚Äî the third stroke can be the straw that breaks the camel‚Äôs back!

Long story short, I had a 14 hour seizure resulting in the stroke literally two days after my head CT.

She gave me a complete physical and ran lab tests, found nothing that she felt was concerning, decided that I was having prescription side effects and emotional issues, prescribed antidepressants and sent me on my way.  I found out I had a stroke when I went to a neighborhood ER for something unrelated and the doctor who examined me noticed neurologic abnormalities in the way I walked and held my arms and ordered a catscan.  I ended up being transported to a large hospital and spent several days having tests ran but no cause was found.  I was put on Plavix and referred to a cardiologist who ruled out anything heart related. A year later, I  had a TIA  and spent another week in the hospital repeating all the tests and having even more done.  No cause was found and they added low dose aspirin to the Plavix. I was referred to a consulting neurologist who went through years of my medical records and had me see some other specialists to look for causes. It\'s thought that my stroke was caused by complications from a then - undiagnosed autoimmune disease.  But there\'s no way to know for certain now. I think once you\'re safe to, keep looking for a cause. Everyone just said ""well sometimes people have strokes and never know what caused them"" and essentially just be grateful the deficits weren\'t severe and I was able to lead a mostly normal life.

253,OT Quick Tip,16,kf11g1,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/kf11g1/ot_quick_tip/,11,"**Quick Tip: Use It or Lose It** 

How many times have you heard that? Probably too many to count. But that‚Äôs because it bears repeating, especially in stroke recovery. 

It‚Äôs common after a stroke to develop something called **‚Äúlearned non-use.‚Äù** You can probably guess what it means, but I‚Äôll expand. 

This phenomenon is when you have an affected limb and find compensatory ways to do things, ultimately leading you to not use that affected limb nearly as much. 

Now, it might be necessary at some point in your recovery to adapt or compensate to get things done. But if you stop using your affected limb altogether, especially early in your recovery, your brain will no longer prioritize those pathways. 

The brain effectively shuts down those pathways. This is what we call **‚Äúsynaptic pruning.‚Äù** 

When you don‚Äôt use your affected limb, the brain will direct resources elsewhere, and it will get harder over time to use that limb. 

**The bottom line:** if you want to get as much use out of your affected limb as possible, use it! The movement may not be perfect or pretty. And that‚Äôs okay!

**I hope you‚Äôre finding a deeper dive into some of these topics from my blog helpful.** [Find my post on neuroplasticity by clicking here if you haven‚Äôt read it yet.](https://elysenewland.com/articles/neuroplasticity-the-best-stroke-recovery-tool)",2020-12-17 16:49:29+00:00,"[""But if you can't open your hand due to spasticity to help open a bottle or dry yourself off then what are you supposed to do to get it involved?

This can be one of the most frustrating things about recovery. You‚Äôre doing all of your exercises, doing more daily activities around the house, etc., but you just don‚Äôt see any changes.   
I have good news. As long as you keep doing those things, your brain is still trying to make changes. So even if you don‚Äôt see external changes quickly, internal progress is still happening!

I woke up one morning, and the world had changed. There was just something wrong, and I couldn't wrap my head around it. I thought that maybe I'd hit my head sleeping or something, but the world didn't right itself the next day. I was scared. 

Shortly thereafter, my left side began to atrophy, and I lost feeling in my arm, face, torso, and leg. However, since I didn't have health insurance, I couldn't see a doctor.  I made too much money to get access to public health care, and working in non-profit doesn't exactly come with good health care options to begin with, I was alone to deal with this. It was getting scarier.

Since I didn't know what happened, didn't have a diagnosis, and didn't have a way out, I had to deal with it myself. When it took my leg, I had to teach myself to walk again. I had to learn how to speak after it fried my brain. I pushed myself as hard as I could, but it wasn't enough. I believed that I was dying, and there was no hope.

My father has been in town visiting and staying with me since Christmas. On Tuesday I left in the morning to work as normal and saw my father a few minutes before leaving at 7:30am. All was well and we exchanged good mornings while I handed him a cup of coffee. Left for work to return that evening around 5:30pm. 

Upon returning home I walked in the door and he was making spaghetti. We chatted for a few about the day and then I went for a 50 minute run. When I got home he was starting to boil the pasta, and while putting a load of laundry in the wash realized I was out of detergent. Walked back into the kitchen to inform him I was going to run to the store (mile away) to get detergent, and asked if we needed anything else. He told me he walked to the store earlier, and got eggs, pancake mix, and the next thing he couldn‚Äôt think of the words which I attributed to him being old and forgetful. 

Went to the store and returned 15 minutes later to find him finishing the pasta. He was straining it over the sink (had made in a standard pot with a lid) and he then dumped it all in the sink. I laughed and informed him there is a pasta pot in the cupboard and pulled it out to show him. He looked and it blankly, and didn‚Äôt say a thing. I joked about it, and then went on my way to grab food. After I had my pasta and sauce, and while he was grabbing his I asked him a question which I don‚Äôt remember exactly. When he replied I couldn‚Äôt understand a single thing he said, it was as if he was speaking a foreign language I never heard. I looked at him, and he didn‚Äôt look right so I asked him if he was ok? His reply was the same jumbled mess of un recognizable words. At that point I said ‚Äúwe are going to the hospital‚Äù, and decided he was having a stroke. 

Turns out he has an undiagnosed AVM and it started bleeding. Thankfully I have one of the best neuro units in the nation three miles from my home. I know this because not a year ago I was diagnosed with an un-ruptured cerebral aneurysm and was treated there. Got him to ER and they ran stroke protocol immediately. Thankfully the bleed was slow and with blood pressure meds they were able to limit the effects. 

Angiogram the following morning to plug the AVM issue and a few days later he is doing well. His speech is still affected but has recovered a lot (60%?) since admitting. Today he moved from ICU to a downgraded recovery unit, and tomorrow we talk with the speech therapist to game plan the weeks, and months moving forward. Thankfully he‚Äôs still here, and speech seems to be the only motor function affected by the bleed.

Then on my sixth birthday I went to the hospital because I seemed to be favoring my right side. When I got to the hospital I went unconscious and the doctors took me back for emergency surgery. 

A neurologist did brain surgery on me and took the right side of my skull out to allow my brain to swell freely. After the surgery they put me in a medically induced coma for three days. After these three days I went back into surgery where they put my skull back in. The doctors had no idea what had happened to me, they had to talk with a doctor from Canada and this doctor had only seen this case in one other patient. 

I had developed a blood clot from the chicken pox which stopped the blood to my brain causing me to have a stroke on my left side.

I have a lot of background experience in design, and also I am a caregiver for stroke patient.

I want to create Stroke survivor and Caregiver guidebooks, that are free, easy to access, and maybe help someone when they find themselves in our situation.

I have a couple of topics in my mind that I want to cover, but I would need help from all of you to create this :)

If you by any chance have some topics or the situations you found yourself during the recovery process that you want to be explained or you would find useful, please leave it in the comments.

268,9 years on and I'm still messing up,15,pnqqxk,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/pnqqxk/9_years_on_and_im_still_messing_up/,43,"Hello first time here. This post really isn't about me but more about my mum. Even writing this I'm trying hard not to break down. My mum had her stroke 16May 2012. So 9 years ago. You see unlike everyone here who is smart and courageous. I didn't phone 999. I waited at least 10 hours to phone maybe more. This decision cost my mother and my brothers childhood. I was 20 so old enough to know better. I want to go into too much details. But she was in the kitchen I was in the other room. I heard a smash. I ran out and asked what happened mum was barely holding onto the counter . I helped her sit down and said we need to phone a ambulance. This is where I messed up I should never h ad asked. Instead I should have phoned immediately. Mum refused said she was fine. But her words were slurring I argued she said no. And we went back and forth. I didn't call. I never called. To  this day i don't know why. Mum was ill she had no idea what was happening I could of ph oned 999 secretly. I hindered a better recovery. Guys I left her to pop to the shops. And I made sandwiches. Honestly who does that ? I stayed with her and monitored her finally phoning 999. The paramedics told me off. The nurse in charge questioned me why didn't I phone sooner? My brother blames me. My uncle blames me. And everyone is right. I cannot explain to you how painful regret and guilt is. For the past 9 years I've hated myself.  I drank,smoke and self harmed. Everyday I'm reminded of my failures. I see mum and I see what could of been. I've read so many stroke stories on here,facebook,YouTube and stroke association. And the one thing is common their loved ones called 999 as soon as possible.
I always wonder how different mums recovery would have been. But that's not only it my was recently Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Again something I caused I fed her terribly.  Again I've let her down. I could of prevented it. Now I'm more  afraid,ashamed and scared. It never stops. I've let my mum and brother down continously. I'm afraid it's gonna happen again. I don't why I'm here. I'm sorry if my story has upset you. I wanna apologise for failing my mother and also for not being a decent human being. It's hard to live its hard to exist. I just want to stop but it If i go, my mum and brother have no one. So I'm left with guilt eating me up. I just I could go back and phone 999 as soon as possible. Life is so hard. And we are all so hopeless. I see how depressed my mum And brother is and it's awful. My mum was suicidal due to the diabetes diagnosis. I just wish this was a horrible twisted nightmare that I have yet to wake up from. It seems like nothing gets better. And we are all tired. Both me and mum are suicidal and my brother is extremely depressed. I just want my old mum back. I wish I had the stroke and not her. You know what the worst thing is my mum lost everyone and everything giving birth to me. Her family wanted her to have a abortion.Her brother warned her I would be her biggest mistake of her life. They were so right I just wished she listened to them.",2021-09-13 23:13:46+00:00,"[""Man, I'll tell you what: regret is a part of life. I'm 42 years old. I was raised by my grandparents, and had a good childhood because of them. My dad (grandpa) had a heart attack and it changed his demeanor when I was about 17. He was angry, short, and started smoking again after having quit for a decade. I was a stupid, selfish teenager and had enough - he was a dick all the time after that heart attack. One day we got into it, and I finally decided I'd had enough, and shoved him down into a chair; angrily, and feeling like a tough guy, I stormed out. Got a call (actually, got beeped on my pager - that's how old I am) about an hour later - he had another heart attack, this time fatal. My last interaction with my dad, I yelled at him and shoved him, and he died. I've lived with the guilt and shame my entire life. I went to dark places I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. But I decided I would learn from that experience and be better. And I think I have been. Not a day goes by where I don't actively think about that experience, and I actually encourage those thoughts, because it makes me want to better myself. That was 22 years ago. Since then, I've experienced epic heartbreaks, deaths of dear friends and beloved family, grief like you wouldn't believe - THEN I had a stroke at age 37 and it destroyed my career, and any future I might've been carving out for myself. But those experiences have taught me honesty, and that honesty has brought me true joy and love from the people around me and that's no shit. Life is tedious; cruel and unfair. But it is also beautiful if you seek out the beauty, and it's worth it. Keep your trusted compatriots close, be true and honest with good people, and you'll see a return. And hang in there - there's a lifetime of experiences you've yet to have beyond any current heartache. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel, you just have to want to find it."", ""Don't be guilty over what has passed...not everyone is aware of Stroke sign..be strong and positive..don't blame yourself for something you are not cause of...if u believe in divine power get closer to God..hw can u be responsible over every wrong thing happening araund..??

Not everyone calls emergency right away.', 'It‚Äôs not your fault or maybe it is but there‚Äôs no point in dwelling on it. All you can do is do better starting now.  \n\nI‚Äôm in a similar situation. I could have prevented my moms stroke. I was right next to her when she had her first TIA or mini stroke. Her vision got blurry, and she had a headache and didn‚Äôt know why. We were going through a really stressful time because a property we owned had just flooded. I just assumed she was stressed out. I even googled her symptoms right then and there and stroke was at the top of the causes, but I didn‚Äôt think there was even a remote chance she was having something that serious. She was fine after a few mins and we went on with our day. A few days later I went back to my charmed life in Los Angeles and she continued on her life in Michigan. \n\nMonths later she had a very serious stroke that paralyzed her left side. If we had gone to the doctor months prior, she could have been put on proper medications. I will carry that guilt with me for the rest of my life. When she had the serious stroke, I was in LA, but my brother was with her. He took her to an eye doctor right away because at the onset of the stroke, her vision went dark in one eye. The eye doctor said it was a migraine and sent us home. He could have said ‚Äústroke, emergency room now‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt. He minimized my moms symptoms and now she‚Äôs fucking disabled. She‚Äôs lost her independence. I had to leave my 6 figure dream job in LA to become her caretaker. Everyday I‚Äôm so angry, sad, and depressed. I should be doing exercises with her everyday, trying to regain her arm function. But I‚Äôm so depressed I can barely get of bed. And the moment I do, everything I do is for her. From the moment I wake, I‚Äôm making her food, drinks, dressing her, dealing with her appointments and insurance. I‚Äôm just exhausted. Riddled with guilt and anger. In my book, a successful day is one where I don‚Äôt think about shooting myself in the face. I don‚Äôt have many successful days. It‚Äôs been 3 years of this. I used to see myself on TV everyday. My band was signed to interscope, a major record label. And I lived in a gorgeous penthouse loft in downtown LA. Now I‚Äôm broke and don‚Äôt really see any happiness in my future. I accept this as my punishment for not getting my mom the help she needs but also a chance to make up for what happened get her the best care. You know your mom better than anyone. You guys have your own language that no one outside that family knows how to speak. Even though you may feel guilt for your role in the situation, the only thing that will help alleviate that guilt is trying harder and you‚Äôre one of the only people thats in a position to do so. \n\nAnd one last thing. Even if you had called emergency services right away, it‚Äôs not guaranteed that the clot busting medication would have been successful. Complications from that medication include brain bleeding and death. So you‚Äôll never really know what would have happened.', 'My mom is a nurse. I had my stroke literally in front of her and she didn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what happened at the time.

I insisted on going to the hospital because something was weird, and she drove me. And turns out after some tests that yep, it was a stroke. \n\nSo don‚Äôt blame yourself.

Ischemic strokes make up around 87% of all strokes in the United States, per the American Heart Association. They involve a blood clot or a blocked vessel in the brain which then causes that area of the brain to be without oxygen.

There are two types of ischemic strokes:

1. **Thrombotic:** A thrombus is a blood clot that forms in a blood vessel and does not move. When a thrombus forms in the brain, it can result in a stroke. It can have either a sudden onset or be gradual over several hours or days.
2. **Embolic:** An embolus is a particle, most often a blood clot but it can also be air, fat, or bacteria. In an embolic stroke, the embolus forms in one area of the body and travels to another part of the body. Most often a sudden and abrupt onset of symptoms.

There 2 primary causes of ischemic strokes:

1. **Atherosclerosis**: This is the build-up of plaques in blood vessels. Plaques are fatty substances, cholesterol, and/or cell waste. The plaque build-up can cause a blockage in blood vessels. This leads to vessel narrowing and decreased blood flow to cells.
2. **Atrial Fibrillation:** Harvard Health notes that 1 in 6 ischemic strokes can be traced to atrial fibrillation (or AFib). AFib is one of the most common types of heart rhythm irregularities. When someone‚Äôs heart is in AFib, the chambers of the heart don‚Äôt beat in rhythm. This means that some blood remains in those chambers instead of pumping out.",2021-05-13 14:26:29+00:00,['Great post. May I offer a couple of clarifications?'],278

I (30M) was told by my neurologist Friday that since my last MRI 7 years ago, it appears that I have had a ""small stroke"" in the cerebellar region of my brain. Obviously we are getting lots of testing done over the next couple of weeks and I have follow-ups with all kinds of different doctors. However, I have severe medical anxiety and hearing that I had had a stroke is literally one of my worst fears. I don't remember having any symptoms and I have no impairments but I am still terrified now that I will have a symptomatic stroke in the coming months. Sleeping has been hard, I live alone so I'm constantly worried I won't be able to call for help if I need it, etc. But my neurologist acted so nonchalant about it! Am I just overthinking all of this? It also bugs me to no end that there's no way to tell when this stroke happened - it could have been 6 months ago or 6 years ago! To top it off, I have migraines with aura which only worsens my anxiety about having a stroke since the symptoms are so stroke-like. I am going crazy with all of this.

I'm hoping after all the testing, following up, etc., etc., I will feel more reassured. I'm just struggling right now. I will say that since she told me about the stroke, I have changed my diet completely. I am currently following the DASH diet (though appetite is extremely low right now due to anxiety). I quit smoking 2 months ago for different reasons which my neuro says was probably the biggest preventative thing I could have done. I've been getting at least 30 minutes of walking in a day, and adding yoga and mindfulness practices to my day-to-day. Checking in with PCP and cardiologist to get mildly elevated BP under control as well as triglycerides, and getting an echo with bubble study and carotid doppler (but not until the end of May, which is adding to anxiety).

Not about getting a stroke, I have high blood pressure that led to my stroke and I never stayed on top of it, that's on me and I'm dealing with my mistake. What I'm frustrated with is how since the day I left inpatient everyone from my family to my doctor's to my therapist have failed me. 

First off my family was naive to the severity of a stroke so my support system wasn't there from the start. Those were really dark days because they didn't prepare for my stroke in the slightest by studying about my condition and assumed I would get better in 4 months. I was expected to navigate the medical system myself, I would like to think it's because they were confused and not because they couldn't be bothered. Although I did start my therapy a month late because they wanted to take a 3 week vacation to Utah and when I did, instead of getting the best help, I had to prioritize the distance from my home as to not inconvenience them.

Well of course I made all the arrangements myself, unfortunately I was forced to do it while still recovering from my brain injury as I was dealing with depression and exhaustion. I'm mad as hell looking back, but what's the point of bringing it up now after the fact? I needed help and they weren't there for me, what can you do? I ended up moving out of my uncle's house who I've been living with for 10 years and back in with my mom to get support.

What I needed was a professional to advocate for me on my behalf because I had no idea what to ask for as a recovering stroke survivor. There was no guidance from anyone and when I asked a stupid question I was made to feel stupid for asking it. I ended up choosing the wrong therapist that weren't equipped to help me, but of course they decided to keep seeing me and charge my insurance because I didn't know better. I became a guinea pig for students and never once saw a licensed therapist. My golden months were wasted as I left my former life with regret.

Fast forward to today, the end of next month will be my one year anniversary since my stroke. Everything bit of progress I have accomplished to this day was because I took my recovery into my own hands. I'm with a new health network and working with actual licensed therapist once a week in a hospital. But all is not perfect... 

Almost a year later I'm barely having my first meeting with a neurologist outside of the ICU and I just found out that I have  clonus which throws off my balance when walking. Turns out my orthotist that built my AFO adjusted it incorrectly and I've been hyperextending my knee exasperating the clonus this whole time. 

This whole process has been something else, what really frustrates me is how recovered I am as someone who did most of it on his own. It's frustrating because if I had the proper help and support from the beginning I feel like I would be at 90% right now. I wish it wasn't so but this past year I've grown to be pessimistic after what I went through, the health system is broken and real family can be counted on one hand. I truly hope the second year is better because it can't get much worse.",2021-03-14 22:15:55+00:00,"['I hear you loud and clear about needing a professional to advocate.

I spend days researching the best doctors in the area because I just wanted him better. I wanted him to be there for his daughter and to live the life he should. Unfortunately, he has gone into this deep depression mode and just wants to sleep everyday. He suffered from depression prior to the stroke but it has gotten significantly worse since.

While I did receive some help from family with some loads of dysfunctional bullshit, and so much generosity from my amazing friends, I lost my mind so many times in the first year because I was doing the rehab work, researching, reading, getting counseling, eventually acupuncture and cranial sacral therapy and under so much pressure to take care of so much.  The pressure was too great while fatigued, having a flat affect, cognitive blips, processing difficulties and physical weakness, etc.  I lost my career and passion of 12 years, my income, the health insurance and my benefits, etc.  My union didn\'t even help me.  Depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicidal ideation are very common in stroke survivors.  Neuro fatigue is real.  And, sleep is so very healing.  (Read Stronger After Stroke by Peter G. Levine.)  My exes 3 parents were all health care professionals and were helpful at first, but in some ways completely in denial when I reached out to them.  My ex mother in law said to me ""Don\'t you think your expectations of a husband are too high?""  This is a woman who left her marriage with 2 teenagers at home.   It took me months to convince my ex that he needed caregiver support and to go to counseling.  And, maybe help with his drinking.  But, it was too late.  He went to one caregiver meeting.  When we finally got to couples therapy still, he refused to step up at least temporarily to earn extra money on the side while I recovered and figured out my new existence.   I truly loved him.  I did, but I couldn\'t take care of him while trying to fight and advocate for treatment and do my own processing and rehab.  My marriage and our 2 kitties, our simple family was the most important thing to me.  I had been the breadwinner and carrier of the benefits and planner and organizer.  He dug his heels in deeper.  And, his resistance grew.  He dove deeper into drinking and slowly abandoned me on various levels.  Typical strategy when a man and his family want to blame the \'hysterical woman\'.  At least that\'s what it felt like...  I was a victim of DV one night when he came home in a black out and startled me awake at 3am, less than one year after stroke.  I eventually broke up with him and kicked him out of the flat.  I haven\'t even come close to recovering my broken heart and have struggled financially since then in a very expensive city.  I still suffer with MH issues including PTSD.  I truly believed if he had been more pro active and showed deeper interest in the details of my recovery early on, I would have broken down less and my first year would have been much better.  And, my overall recovery would be much better.   It\'s a deep and sacred wound.  I have done a lot of work around codependency and it helps, but I am shattered in some places of my soul.   I share this story because it\'s a little discussed aspect of the stroke journey.  And, some people may benefit from it.  Some friends, family, lovers and partners aren\'t built for the stroke journey.  And, some need to go!']",282

**Every survivor's journey is different.**  

Know that if you've recently had a stroke and you're sleeping a lot, **that's okay**. Your body and brain are recovering from an injury. Give yourself some slack and sleep when you're tired.  

You may be on the other side of the spectrum and have difficulty getting to sleep.  

Aside from the brain injury itself, **think about what else might be causing this problem.**  

Are you worried about something coming up? Is your body tired but your brain just won't shut up? Do you have pain or discomfort?  

The first step to getting better sleep is to **identify** what issues are keeping you from it in the first place!

 ‚ÄîCarl Jung

Traumatic experiences change us. It feels like they change the very DNA that we‚Äôre made up of.

I‚Äôm going to share something with you, not because it‚Äôs easy for me, but because I believe healing can come through sharing. We can all learn something by sharing our trauma versus bottling it up and letting it eat away at us.

I went through some years of domestic abuse as a young woman. It changed me, and it's something that continues to affect me. 

But at some point, I decided that the trauma I experienced was not going to be my defining characteristic. I decided that regardless of the lingering issues I was dealing with, I would choose who I wanted to be. It's not been an easy process, but it has been necessary.

**Trauma will impact us, but we don't have to let it define us.**

We want to give him a fighting chance to live. But we also don‚Äôt want to be selfish and keep him alive if his quality of life is going to be severely limited. I think he would hate us for doing that because he lives to move around and do things on his own. 

Please tell me you or your family‚Äôs experiences with strokes. Good or bad. I need a bit of hope that he‚Äôll make it through and that it‚Äôs possible to recover from this but I also need to know the reality of things. 

And if you can, please say a small prayer for my uncle. I‚Äôm not very religious but right now I‚Äôm desperately praying to God that he‚Äôll pull through. He‚Äôs a good man and he has so much he still needs to live for. He has a grandson that‚Äôs about to turn a year old that he still needs to watch grow. He has his daughter who never got to mending her relationship with him. He‚Äôs like a second father to me and I‚Äôm so heart broken over everything.

291,My 40 year old Husband Had a Stroke Yesterday,16,gja1e0,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/gja1e0/my_40_year_old_husband_had_a_stroke_yesterday/,15,"Hi, 

My 40 year old husband just had a stroke.  He does have congestive heart failure and A Fib.  My husband lost his job on March 31 and has been home since then.  Just saying that because a) I think it added to his stress and b) luckily we were both home (I'm working from home right now)  

Yesterday at about noon, I went into the other room to talk to him about something and he was breathing very shallowly and fast.  Something just did not look ""right"" on his face - I don't know how else to put it.  I was very panicked and asked him if he wanted me to call 911 and he said yes. 

I called 911 and the paramedics arrived and took vitals/asked him how he was doing.  He was able to tell them his birth date, but when they asked if he knew where he was, he said no. 

He was taken to the emergency room at 12:30, and had a CT scan.  That initial scan didn't show anything.  An uptake scan was done after that, which also didn't show anything.  At 9:30 pm, he was FINALLY admitted into a room on the Covid floor (!).  That's because since he had ""shortness of breath"", they swabbed him and treated him like a Covid patient until the test came back negative.  After that came back negative tonight, he was taken into another room for non corona cases. 

His MRI came back today which showed a stroke.  He can't speak and he can't really move his arms very well.  He is tracking well with his eyes and able to move his legs/feet.  When I FaceTimed him today, he was making grunting noises when I was talking to him.  

The neurologist stated that they expect him to make a 70-80% improvement over the next few weeks.  He will stay at the hospital right now, and then be moved to a rehabilitation center.  

All of this right after he was fired from his job, sill waiting on his unemployment.  This is just a LOT to handle.  I feel like I've been stalking all of the Dr.'s and nurses via phone since I can't actually be there in person.  I have made like 12 different phone calls and am very stressed.

I was mostly paralyzed on the right side of my body and I had aphasia...I couldn't remember my wife's and my kid's names, my zip code, I couldn't come up with basic words like pencil, cup or picture.  Every stroke patient is different, but I slowly battled back and recovered.  It is now almost 5 years ago and most people can't tell that I had a stroke.   I know that it was very hard for my wife, but I had a very good attitude about my recovery which helped me I'm sure.  I wish you and your husband the best."", ""What everyone is saying. I know it's a stressful time but it seems like it was caught earlier, there's no place better for him to be then the hospital, try calling him instead those 12 times XD tell him about the day, if he wants to tell you things don't push too much for it to be perfect and try not to be stressed yourself, it will pass!"", 'They made an exception and I was able to visit him yesterday.

292,I wish I had paid more attention to my father.,14,ekb9dw,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ekb9dw/i_wish_i_had_paid_more_attention_to_my_father/,13,"Christmas Eve my father wasn't feeling well and had gone to the hospital in Perth ontario. They said he needed to go near by to another hospital in Smith falls Ontario to get a CT scan. He was having severe headaches, memory loss, among other things. They sent him back to Perth to wait. Because of low staffing for the holidays my father decided to go home. They called once we were home and told us they had seen something on the scan and for us to return back the next day. 

I hadn't seen my father until he got home. I didn't realize the severity of what was going on. He was eating food saying he was so hungry and tired he would go back in the morning and see what they say. I tell my mom don't worry about Christmas just take him first thing when he's up. Don't bug him just let him sleep and we take him in the morning.. 

I saw him later in the night. Something was wrong with the internet and he knows everything there is to know, it's his set up. I pretended not to watch, my father is private, but something wasn't right. The mouse was just moving around the screen. It looked like he couldn't remember even the basics of how to work a computer. But he was tired and not wearing his glasses. I gave him the benefit of the doubt of maybe I just didn't want to believe something was wrong. He's always been the one to be able to figure something out or help you. 

They went back first thing. I left to go home to my apartment. I called them everyday after asking if he was ok. He promised me he was feeling better... Just having memory issues for some reason. I should have tried to talk to him more. These were short conversations. He trys not to show us when he's hurt. He tries to take care of everyone. Apperently the hospital turned them away because they couldn't help because of the holiday. It was December 25th. I didn't know this and I guess my father in his condition didn't understand he needed to go. He needed to be there the very next day too then. I should have seen it and took him but I didn't know they just didn't help him because of Christmas til after everything..

New year's Day I wake up to a call from my mother. Theyre at the hospital in my town now. Kgh in Kingston Ontario. He's had a stroke, he's not able to talk, he can't move his right hand. We can't communicate with him, but we believe he understands us. They say weleft it too long and I completely blame myself.

Your dad is still here, even if he can't talk right now."", "" Please don't blame yourself. It sounds like your dad is like me. He's stubborn.

Maybe hearing stories of those who recovered will bolster your spirits! My dad had a similar experience, he did not have the typical stroke symptoms which made it very hard to diagnose. He just seemed kind of sick, for hours, and was hiding it from my mom (very frustrating but anyway) by the time they finally had an ambulance come and got him to the hospital it was too late for any sort of actual stopping of the stroke. He had speech issues and balance issues along with issues on his right side. With rehab and practice he's nearly back to normal at least able to drive. My dad is very stubborn though and doesn't like to do his therapy and practice his speech so that didn't get as good as I think it could have but honestly it's night and day compared to now he was in the hospital. Don't worry! Improvement is definitely going to happen and have lots of hope and make sure the doctors educate him on what's important during his recovery! Make sure he makes the most of the programs he can utilise! Best wishes"", ""I felt the same way.  My dad had a couple unusual things happen during the week before and I told him to go get checked but ultimately he decided not to and ended up having a major stroke.  At the beginning he could understand us but not speak, and had no use of his right side.  He couldn't swallow either.\n\nI blamed myself a lot at first because I'm a nurse.  I felt like I should have forced him to go, or made a bigger fuss or something.  But ultimately we will never know if what he experienced beforehand was a precursor to the stroke or not, and ultimately blaming myself is no use to anyone now.\n\nHe was in hospital for just over 3 months, and then in a rehab facility for 3 months.  He had to re-learn how to make sound, then how to form the sound.  He still only says a few things generally.  He had to re-learn how to walk and he still can't use his right arm after almost 2 years.\n\nMy Dad's stroke happened overnight so it was too late for the clot busting drug, and when they tried to remove the clot they ended up pushing it further in and couldn't retrieve it.  We also had a super scary hour or so when they thought he may have a serious brain bleed.  Thank goodness he didn't.\n\nAnyway your Dad has a long road ahead of him and needs your love and support.  Instead of blaming yourself, just focus on being there for him.  Early on for my Dad I did some passive range of motion exercises on his weak side to keep his limbs flexible, and asked about a million questions to learn as much as possible.  I also wrote everything down in a little notebook which I then would refer back to frequently.\n\nMy little goals each day were to appreciate that he was still with us, and to be there for him and my Mom and my brothers.  No more than that.\n\nStay strong friend, and please stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault."", ""Update. It's been 5 days but I saw my dad nod yes today. Im pretty positive that it was him responding to my brother telling him we loved him and we were gonna be back soon. And he squeezed my hand with his good hand.

It was then I discovered I\'d had a stroke. At least he thought it looked like an old stroke (old meaning at least a couple of days or earlier). I was transferred to a large hospital with a neuroscience floor and had loads of tests. Turns out I had a stroke and never knew it. Probably in my sleep. A year later, when I had my TIA, I knew something was wrong right away and looked in the mirror and saw my face was drooping and called 911. The operator could tell I was slurring my words and the ambulance came and took me to the hospital. But my symptoms were already resolving by the time I arrived in the ER. So yeah, the stroke must have happened in my sleep. I knew the TIA was happening as soon as it started.', ""Was on the train headed to work just felt really tired.

295,A life for a life.,16,b9fmcp,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/b9fmcp/a_life_for_a_life/,9,"5 months ago I took the hardest hit I have ever taken.  I experienced a pontine stroke that completely wrecked me.  Within a few hours, my deteriorated condition, paralysis, and aphasia basically had hospital staff preparing my wife for the worst case scenario. I persisted.  They then prepared her for the eventuality I'd be in pure muscle lock. I persisted.  I can't tell you about life the first 4-6 weeks, but I remember the dissociative periods where I felt who I am was trapped inside a damaged mind. Watching helplessly as I had to be tended to.  In a colloquial sense I repossessed my mind.  I came to reality, for once living in the moment.  I was unable to experience fear, love, desire, hunger; just simply exist second to second.  I talked to myself, literally spoke aloud to motivate myself to will.  I came to existence after weeks.  My first continual memory was having to see my dog put down after 15 years.  I felt pain.  In a masochistic sense I stood apart from the pain and realized I felt.  I saw past the day.  I was having memories return.  I lived a life where I had minimal advantage, but knew the value of discipline.  I was on a walker, in diapers, could barely eat....but I knew inside me was myself.  That same stubborn sob that refused to accept what was told to me.  I started from scratch- practiced ABC'S, read aloud, recorded how many feet I could walk without support.  I didn't expect an immediate result or perfection.  My wife lost her job tending to me, savings and retirements gone- the material of who I was unthreaded.  I watched as all I was burned away, yet also realized that life did die.  It was important to rebirth myself.  My new job was myself.  I pushed through pain and disappointment because failure for me was staying down.  It's been 5 months, I walk, talk, engage in intellectual debate, and gained everything but my left arm.  I had a PFO closed in my heart as well.  I finally was approved for PT and I'm slowly gaining my left arm back.  I always described myself as indefatigable in interviews, but finally understood what it means to be unrelenting.  I took a new life , and if one person can the possibility exists for us all to. I just had to give up my old life and rebuild after the disaster.  I had to believe in me, not what others said I'd be. If anything, please don't quit on yourself. Find your normal and work towards establishing it.  You definitely get to enjoy the shock in medical professionals expressions when you're no longer  lifeless on a hospital bed.

TL;DR: I was basically prepared to be defeated by the supposed insurmountable odds, statistics, and expectations of my type of stroke.  Fortunately for me, statistics couldn't measure my spirit and the fight.

Like wtf just tell me one way or the other.\n\nTIAs are temporary. They mimic a stroke, but they do not cause permanent damage. Strokes do cause permanent damage. Some areas, big or small, suffered cell death. Some people go to the hospital because they are having am issue, like a bleed or a clot, and they need medical intervention because it is an ongoing event. Some people pass their clots, or the bleeding stops on its own. Sounds like you fell into the latter category, as in, your clot *did* cause permanent damage, therefore it's a stroke (the most common one is by a clot, btw), but they don't have to go in and bust it up before it causes more damage.\n\nOnce you have had a stroke, your chances of having a second stroke go up significantly. So you will most likely be told to be on the preventative medication for the duration of your life. It might get changed. I went from baby aspirin to Alka seltzer for two reasons: the baby aspirin messed with my GI tract, and it wasn't thinning my blood enough to their liking. Luckily I don't have to take a stronger thinner. But my stroke happened deep within the white matter of the brain, where the vessels are as thin as a strand of hair. So yeah, they want me on a thinner in case a larger clot forms and does a serious amount of damage. I know I got very, very lucky.\n\nI would advise to get a medical bracelet stating you are on blood thinners. Once the dust settles and your new reality feels a bit more normal. Take some time for yourself to emotionally accept and understand what has happened. You're going to go through a lot of emotions. They are natural, so do not feel ashamed or discouraged.\n\nHealing is not linear. You'll have good days and bad. You'll have a slew of good days and you'll feel like you're on a roll, then you'll have a bad day and feel worse than you did before. Be gentle with yourself.\n\nSeek counseling if you need to. There is no shame in it. My stroke was four years ago, and I only just started therapy earlier this year. Should have done it long, long before. There's such a negative stigma surrounding mental health, and I was raised to think only crazy people went to therapy. It's hard to overcome that. But I'm glad I did. It's not even anything major, but it's nice to know someone is there. Build a good support team. And if you're unhappy with someone in charge of your care, find someone you are comfortable with. For some reason, neurologists tend to have really poor bedside manners. It's tough to find a good one.

I've been reading a book called, ""The Happiness Trap"" by Dr. Russ Harris. It's based on a mindfulness-based approach called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). This book was kindly gifted to me by a friend who also struggles with mental health issues.

The authors discuss the **myth** that all humans are supposed to be happy all the time. When we're not happy all the time, we go through a vicious cycle of thinking there is something wrong with us. We see others (especially on social media) putting their happiest faces out there for all to see, and we wonder what we're doing wrong.

The thing is, humans don't live in a baseline or perpetual state of happiness. Life is filled with ups and downs. That's just the way it is. But all of those experiences make us who we are and help us appreciate the ups even more.

I love this quote, and I think it's especially relevant to stroke recovery.

Going through rehab then returning home to continue recovery can be such a stressful and frustrating time. You may experience unexpected limitations that impact your day-to-day life.

Even though it's incredibly frustrating, keep putting in the work. Keep doing your therapy, daily activities, exercises, and things that are important to you.

You likely won't see the progress immediately. But if you put in the work, you will see improvements later.

The key is to **keep trying**.

315,Advice for Family,15,m20ica,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/m20ica/advice_for_family/,29,"My Mom had a significant hemorrhagic stroke in April of 2020. Recovery has been long, and although progress has been made it is taking a toll on my Dad who is her sole caregiver. I try to get over to their house to relieve him once a week for 6-8hrs, but with a full-time job and spouse/house of my own, even that is challenging. (For reference both parents are 61, and I am a 29F.)

My mother was a difficult person before her stroke, and likely due to bad habits (closet smoker, took all sorts of weight loss pills, diuretics, bing ate) caused her stroke. We have yet to discuss this with her, but while she was in the hospital I cleaned out her room, car, and purse and filled up an entire grocery bag with pills and junk food.

She is not a gracious person, is extremely pessimistic, and has never actually been happy. Some of this was due to her upbringing, but I also think that is just her personality. The stroke has exacerbated those personality traits and it is taking a toll on myself and especially my Dad.

Lines between dad/daughter have been blurred and often times it seems as if I'm a therapist. He apologizes for complaining/venting, and if he needs to do that in order to keep taking care of her I don't mind, but it is starting to have a negative effect on me. I'm put in between both of them regularly and often have to settle arguments while I am there. 

My Mom believes my Dad is ""keeping her prisoner"" and complains about him to her parents who live out of state. My Dad is extremely hurt by this as he is trying to keep her safe during Covid, and she refuses to contact any friends in town she had pre-stroke. She lashes out, and I don't know how to talk to her about her behavior. 

They also decided to move at the beginning of last December, which has added to the stress. My Dad has been trying to set up his hobbies, clean the house, unbox belongings, take care of the dog and 2 cats, yard, all while taking care of my Mom. He gets a max of 1-2 hours a day to himself, which my Mom then guilts him over. I am afraid of the toll this is taking on my Dad. He has visibly aged and is a heart attack survivor so his health and wellbeing are super important. They are also planning on doing a house expansion which will cost over $150K. I think that money would be better spent on home care for my mother, or a companion so my Dad can have time off to do his own things. It doesn't seem like my place to tell them that though.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is how do I help them? How do I help without offending, or stepping out of line? I'm at my breaking point and I know my Dad is getting close to his. Has anyone had a similar experience?

Thank you all for reading. I am glad I found this group as it is the first time I've gotten to talk to people who have been through this.",2021-03-10 15:49:48+00:00,"['Holy smokes. I am so sorry you are going through this! I cannot speak for everyone, but for me and my family, research was very time consuming, and draining. So maybe if you wanted you could look up their insurance plan and give your dad a \'binder\' of things to do like; ""one, call her doc to get home care assistance. Two, use home health care, the more you use it the less she\'ll be  suspicious of them, and get used to them."" I think that would be the most beneficial to your dad as it seems like he does not want to give up too much of their independence. Unfortunately unless she wants to get better she won\'t. Recover is incredibly draining and frustrating, so if she\'s the type to look at easy outs like diet pills it will be incredibly hard for your dad to do on his own. Which is why I think home care would be a helpful bit of structure for her, and maybe your dad could use the time to see a therapist? Therapists are very knowledgeable of \'behavior modifications\' and coping mechanisms he can employ. And if you give him all the tools he could ever need, he may open up to you and start delegating the especially draining tasks, or just, ""Hey could you call so and so your mom is not having a good day and I don\'t have the energy to call them at the moment."" Also, prepared meals are super helpful, that was a big thing my mom commented on how appreciative they were of the frozen home cooked meals they got. Best of luck to you all!', ""I think getting out of the house would be a helpful start.  Change of pace since I'm sure it's been very similar, especially with the pandemic. \n\nMy wife's family is EXTREMELY close and her Uncle suffered a stroke and was given a 1% or less chance of survival last summer.  He's at home now but people are still bringing meals over to him because although he can cook and do most things now on his own (the doctors can't believe his story), he doesn't seem to and he lives on his own.  He still struggles with things and moves slower but he's working on improving.\n\nHe has some friends who were interested in keeping in touch but couldn't stop because they didn't live close enough and with the pandemic, they didn't want to drive and potentially expose him to anything since they would have to stop a lot along the way.  I suggested to one of them if they wanted to do a Zoom call with him on a weekly basis, they were absolutely wanting to and so he was open to trying it.  We moved it to bi-weekly but it's something he looks forward to and last week he had 10 people on the call with him and he was laughing and reminiscing about old times for over 2 hours, when normally it's about 1 hour or a little more. \n\nIt's not a lot but it's something he looks forward to doing now, even though sometimes he says...'bah, no one will probably join this week'.  \n\nGiving him something to look forward to doing or seeing someone (grandkids, friends, family) for whatever reason has been an uplifting things for him.  Sometimes we'll pick him up and take him to my Mother/Father-In Laws for lunch or dinner to give him a chance of pace too.  My wife and I try to stop over a few times a week still, sometimes we just hang out and watch a movie with him.  He likes knowing that we want to spend the time with him and hang out.  He always says, 'It's nice you want to hang with an old man like me'.  \n\nOn the other hand, he yells more than he did before.  He's more stubborn than ever and somedays you just have to understand it's not going to be a good day no matter what you do, no matter what you say, it's going to suck.  I try to remind ourselves when that happens, it's not him... it's the stroke and the battle he had to get to where he is was hell and back.  It doesn't make it easy because when he yells... it's deafening sometimes.  \n\nIt's often odd because sometimes he is very loud and angry with his brothers and sister when they come to help him.  Then we stop by and it's night/day different and he's much nicer.  I'm not saying that is the solution but it's odd how sometimes just a different person gets such a different reaction.  I'm not sure how much family is in the area or friends and how close everyone is but for us, it's been a big help with a lot of family near by and the Zoom call with friends.  Is there a doctor that your Mom can talk to more regularly?  Even if it's just to talk to them.  Maybe if it was presented to your Mom as a 'check up' type situation, even if it's virtual it could be more of a therapy for your Mom to vent/talk about what is bothering her to the doctor and have the doctor tell her their perspective.  Even though it would be a normal general doctor visit or therapy visit, it would be more like a psychiatrist person who could help?  ...but don't present it to her that way because that might cause her to get angry.  Just a thought.\n\nI think my biggest advice would be to see if there is some sort of schedule that could be setup to help your mom with routines outside of maybe the home or normal weekly things.  Try to see how you can involve her in the 'normal' things you guys do (if it's possible given how she is).  My wife's Uncle, we try a lot to include him in the normal stuff (even if it's limited with the pandemic) and I can tell he appreciates it, even if it's a simple trip to the grocery store.  \n\nFor us, the biggest reprieve was getting him vaccinated the other day with the 1st shot.  He's so looking forward to getting the next one and being able to go out again to do things like fishing or just simple things like being at the beer garden to listen to the music and see a bunch of people without the worry. \n\nI know everyone's situation is different and it sounds like it's really becoming hard for everyone.  Try to be there for one another most of all, because it sounds like that is key for everyone staying level headed.  Spring is coming and I'm not sure where you're at, but in the midwest here, it is going to be the biggest game changer for my wife's Uncle and will be kicking recovering into another gear when we can get back outside again.   \n\n\n*(Sorry for the long winded reply, I was just typing this up and thought... maybe I should just delete this because it's got a lot of random thoughts in it and our experience and I have no idea if it'll relate to you but even if there's one thing that helps or you can relate with, I thought I'd post it.)*"", ""I can understand that as my mother has always been pessimistic and I can see the pessimism coming back since her hemorrhage of August last year.

It's upsetting to see her act that way after all he has done and especially all he is doing now to take care of her. \n\nHer mother was always rude and pessimistic as well so I think it's likely hereditary. I vowed when I was very young to never be that way.\n\nOne idea I have considered is bringing my mother home with me sometimes, have you considered doing that (if she is able)? That way you can do your things at home while giving your dad space.

316,OT Tip: Reduce Future Stroke Risk,14,lwvg5n,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/lwvg5n/ot_tip_reduce_future_stroke_risk/,5,"**March is National Nutrition Month** here in the U.S. The American Heart Association has been reiterating the importance of nutrition in initial and secondary stroke prevention.

Fear of having another stroke is something that I know a lot of survivors deal with.

As an occupational therapist, one of the many hats I wear is to help my clients manage their health, including preventative ways to reduce the risk of stroke. That might be through providing solutions to remember to take medications, how to advocate at the doctor, understanding habits and routines around health behaviors, how to get better sleep, and how to adapt tasks.‚Äã

I am developing a course for survivors that centers around evidence-based, preventative ways to reduce stroke risk. Since March is National Nutrition Month, I'm going to share some slides and information from the nutrition module this week!

It's important to know the basics and how diet (the food you eat, not a specific ""diet"") impacts the body, especially related to stroke risk factors. One of the best places to start understanding good nutrition is **macronutrients** aka carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

There are **3 types of carbs** we eat; sugar, starch, and fiber.

* **Simple sugars** are what we might consider table sugar, honey, and can be found in fruits and milk.
* **Starches** are chemically made up of chains of simple sugars that can be quickly broken down by the body to turn into energy. Think corn, peas, whole-grain cereal, and pasta.
* **Fiber,** also known as roughage, usually can't be broken down which is why it plays a HUGE role in healthy digestion. It keeps us fuller longer, can help lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and help keeps us regular. You know what I mean. Starch and fiber often come packaged together. Think sweet potatoes or lentils (skins= fiber, inside= starch).

Why do carbs get such a **bad rap?** Do they deserve it?

I'll dive into it tomorrow! 

Edit: Thank you so much for the Hugz Award! :)

**You're not alone.**  


What are some strategies you can use to help you remember important things?  


* **Keep a Routine**. Humans love routine. We are built to thrive in our routines. By setting up daily and weekly routines to include important activities you need to do, you have a better chance of actually doing them.
* **Use visual cues.** Put up brightly colored post-it notes, pictures, or other visual reminders around your home to cue you on what you need to do. This might include a bright red note over the stove to remind you to turn it off after cooking.‚Äã
* **Everything has a place**. Make sure that important items have a home. It'll make things easier to find in the long run when you know where they belong. For example, put your keys on a key ring or in a bowl by the door you enter/exit most often, and keep them there!
* **Keep a list on your phone.** It can be easy to write things down on a piece of paper. But it can be just as easy to throw that paper away or forget where you put it. Keep grocery lists or medication reminders on your phone using the notes or memos app. You won't throw away your phone!

* Avoiding social interactions

* Exercise
* Get enough sleep
* Get support from friends
* Go outside
* Eat a healthy diet
* Pet an animal

334,My stroke and symptoms,13,9rpy2i,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/9rpy2i/my_stroke_and_symptoms/,8,"I am 55 smoker unhealthy eater
I got the stroke I enabled on Oct 12, I am still in the hospital.
I tried to have a cigarette days after my stroke and I felt the effects in my left leg.
It seemed like all the progress I made prior to that first and only cigarette after my stroke went away. Smoking is out of the question.
My first symptoms occured while outside having a cigarette, both legs suddenly felt like they each weighed  500 pounds and my left hand no longer seem to do what I wanted it to do. I was scared and 2 minutes later I felt a wave coarse though my body and then everything returned to normal. This I now know was a TIA. I had one TIA  a day some lasting far longer then others. At work I had a TIA event that lasted 30 minutes and that scared me but not enough to figure out what the hell was happening.
I was told it could be low blood sugar so I googled that and felt better that it was just low blood sugar ""dumb"". I started taking vitamins and eating more vegetables.
I had another TIA just before going to bed and woke up when I felt someones hand on my stomach, it felt warm. With my right hand I touched this mysterious hand and it turned out to be mine. I got really scared. My left hand was useless, I felt no sensation in my hand. I tried to get out of bed but my legs were not working properly. I spent at least an hour trying to get in a chair but fell down stuck under my desk. I was able to reach out and grab my phone and called 911. It was midnight, an odd time for me to wake up but something woke me up.
The ambulance came and I was whisked away to the Emergency Ward.
I was confused as to what was going on, I was not told what happened. I heard the ambulance driver say the window may be closed, no idea what the hell that meant.
I took something they said would make the platelettes slide easier, my blood sugar was I recall 8.1 but my blood pressure was way up apparently.
I slowly regained use of my left hand and my right leg was normal , my left leg was useless. 
Everyday has been healthy hospital food and physio therapy for 1 hour and the rest of the day sheer boredom. Today is day 14 in the hospital. After many days  using my legs propel myself in a wheelchair I got my legs working strong.
The left leg is still not listening to me 100% but I can now stand up for as long as I wish without being wobbly. I now have permission to walk unassisted but my left leg every once in a while does something unexpected but I have enough brain retraining to correct for a fall. I had been practising air guitar and today I played a guitar the hospital had hidden away, I surprised myself that I had not lost that ability. Yesterday I took a cognitive test to see if my drivers license would get suspended due to my stroke and to my relief  they are Not going to call and have my license suspended but Highly recommend I do not drive until mid November "" rules bahhhh"".
I had a Minor stroke but likely will never get back to my old job outdoors.
So quitting smoking is a good thing and I definetly will eat better.

I refuse to disappoint all the Great nurses and therapist who invested  time and effort to get me walking and functioning. I swear I have not seen a doctor for 10 days, I assume they are being updated. 
Going home  to a new life soon. I will adapt and hope I can walk normaly again. I think my left hand will take a long time to be normal.

Watching television was pointless, I couldn't put together enough or see well enough to follow much of what was happening on the screen. Even after returning home three weeks later my mind had trouble absorbing enough to keep my mind occupied.

Fast forward To Hollywood Studio in Orlando where I live.

Last year, one of my close family members was suffered from a stroke and was recently discharged from the hospital. This was especially tragic because they were in their 30s when it happened and it took everyone by surprise. Things have finally quieted down a bit more and they are no longer in the hospital so we're looking at more long-term care options. Luckily, they have Short-Term Disability as well as Long-Term Disability insurance with their employer and we're looking at applying.

Unfortunately, our doctors are not supportive for his Disability Leave (because of how young they are) even though there is objective evidence through MRI's that there are blood clots in the patient's brain and we don't know what to do. I hate to ask for help but I don't really know where else to turn. It feels awful to know that your loved one is dying and not even the doctors think there is something wrong with them.

I'm looking for any recommendations for physicians near San Jose (up to 50 miles away / willing to do video visits) that are more sympathetic to their condition - or at the very least acknowledge that there is something clearly wrong here as well as any other resources we can look into.

I've already read up quite a bit of research about their current condition along with everything I could find about Disability leave and ERISA. I'm not sure if hiring a lawyer to help out is the right decision - have heard mixed opinions for both sides - thanks for the help

Their business is find all ""good reasons"" to discontinue the disability leave duration so that they can keep more money on their side.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that your family member can lose his/her job if the disability leave lasts too long.

There‚Äôs a notion that their suffering doesn‚Äôt matter because whatever they experience isn‚Äôt as bad as the stroke patient (and I do agree the stroke patient is suffering the most).  But that doesn‚Äôt mean the caregiver isn‚Äôt suffering either.  Friends and family try to be supportive in the first few years, but when the stroke patient cannot communicate, people get bored and impatient when spending time with them. \n\nFrom the perspective of the caregiver, they have lost their spouse, friends, and freedom and live a very lonely life.

But after I left inpatient, the several naps a day, I was suddenly able to take finally raised alarm bells. And I just wish there was a better way to diagnose the difference between, ""Oh this patient is easily distracted"" and, ""This patient has a sleep disorder so their brain is searching out any low effort gratification it can."" To be fair, I believe most of my uncles on my dad\'s side, including my dad, to have ADHD symptoms. So I guess there isn\'t an easy answer especially because in the months after a stroke the patient should sleep more than typical as that\'s how their brains heal. \n\nBut I cannot stress enough how the \'wakefulness enhancing\' medication I am prescribed by my doctor helps me. \n\nTl;dr; Sleep is a huge topic that is both harder to diagnose and can be lumped in with other symptoms, but should be treated as its own issue.

I(30F) live in a different country than my family therefore all the info I have is through my parents.

It happened in the left lobe. In the beginning they told us it was a ''tiny stroke'' and she didn't need an operation but today the doctor said that it was a major vein deep in the brain, lots of bleeding and the operation would be too risky so they made her sleep for 6 days straight to allow recovery. She woke up by herself time to time which we've been told was a good sign.

Today, they finally cut the meds and she woke up couple hours later. Her right side is paralyzed. She had a half smile when my mom called her name and touched her left hand. Her eyes could follow the doctors hand and she squeezed her left hand on command. My dad told me she was looking around, so curious, trying to figure out where she is and what happened. She has a tube that's helping her breathe so we don't know if she can speak yet, it will be removed tomorrow. 

They cannot tell what caused it yet. There's too much blood in the area to see what's happening apparently. They will do the tests again in 10 days so they will let the body recover itself and clean the blood out which we hope will reduce the pressure in the area and the recovery will begin.

And that's where my pain starts. The unknown, the uncertainty. I didn't even know what stroke meant 10 days ago.

As I mentioned last week, it's National Nutrition Month, but March is also **National Brain Injury Awareness Month** in the U.S. I want to make sure we talk about that.

Although brain injury awareness often centers around traumatic brain injuries, stroke is considered an acquired brain injury. This year it's especially important to talk about brain injury awareness due to the current and continuing Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 puts people, especially younger and middle-aged folks at a higher risk for having a stroke. 

Although it's still not well understood why two explanations for this are that Covid-19 causes increased inflammation in the body and that it can cause changes to the lining of blood vessels which both can cause clot formation.

Almost **1 in 3 people under 45** in the U.S. don't know the most common stroke symptoms. Since Covid-19 increases the risk of stroke in young and middle-aged adults, let's review the symptoms. 

You may save someone's life by recognizing the symptoms quickly and getting them help! 

Remember, **BE FAST.** 

**B:** Balance Issues

**E:** Eye/vision changes (blurriness, seeing double)

**F:** Facial drooping

**A:** Arm weakness or numbness

**S:** Speech difficulty or slurring

**T:** Time to call 911!

I recently went to my optometrist because I was having issues seeing words on the television at night and experiencing increased motion sickness in the car. I hadn't been for a check-up in around 2 years so I thought, ""it must be time for a new prescription.""

Instead, my optometrist found that my prescription (acuity) was the same. After lots of testing, he found that I had been using my right eye significantly more than my left. I have essentially stopped using a portion of my left visual field. And just to clarify, I have not had a stroke or brain injury.  

He explained that if we start to favor one eye, our brains will start shifting help to that eye and away from the other that we use less.

You probably know what this is called: **neuroplasticity.** Our brains prune away neural connections when we don't use them and strengthen those we consistently use. This is true for anyone, post-stroke or not.  
‚Äã  
So, I have two tips for today.

1. See an optometrist or ophthalmologist at least once a year, especially after you've had a stroke. They may catch issues that cause dizziness, headaches, or balance problems. You can find a neuro-optometry provider by searching [NORA's website](https://nora.memberclicks.net/find-a-provider#/), the Neuro-Optometric Rehabilitation Association.
2. In your recovery, you'll hear a lot of different things from a lot of different people. If you only remember one thing, remember this: **use it or lose it** and **use it to improve it.** The brain will prune away what's not used but will favor what is practiced! Neuroplasticity is the best tool in the recovery toolbox.

362,"My dad [52M] collapsed last night and wasn‚Äôt responding, his dad had multiple strokes and I‚Äôm seriously worried about him",13,lv4mjw,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/lv4mjw/my_dad_52m_collapsed_last_night_and_wasnt/,14,"Sorry if this is a bit long I‚Äôve [24m]had a pretty awful morning so bare with:

My mum was woken up last night to my dad saying ‚ÄúI feel very dizzy, I can‚Äôt get up‚Äù just before he collapsed whilst sat on the toilet late at night. She went over to him to see his eyes had rolled into the back of his head and he had excreted himself. She started calling his name, which yielded no response, she progressed in her approach to waking him up very quickly to the point that she was screaming my name and my dad‚Äôs name intermittently whilst slapping his face. This happened at 6:00am this morning so when I heard the screaming I knew something was wrong so I ran downstairs and into their bathroom where they both were just as he was coming about, so I can‚Äôt say I saw much of any of what had occurred. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time but she says he wasn‚Äôt breathing at one point and that she had to give him CPR and was slamming his chest and breathing into his lungs because he wasn‚Äôt showing any signs of life. 

For some backstory, My dad (52) is a fairly regular middle aged man, he started cycling and lost a whole load of weight (down from 110 to 90kg) but then got hit by a horse on a bike ride (we live in a slightly rural English town) about 5 months ago and injured himself quite badly and hasn‚Äôt been able to cycle since, his weight has gone up again to around 100/105kg. The real kicker is that his dad had 3 strokes, I was young when they started happening and he passed away when I was in my early teens so it‚Äôs difficult to remember, but I remember 3 of them for sure but it might have been 4. The first of which happened when he was 54 I believe. I remember my grandparents (on my dad‚Äôs side) coming to visit us (we like in the UK and they lived in Eastern Europe). I remember being very young and my mum being extremely worried about my grandad one night because he was eating really weird and not acting normally. My grandma was saying that he was fine and not to worry about him and took him upstairs to bed, whilst she was trying to dab him with cold towels to keep his temperature down. My mum took matters into her own hands and called the ambulance which is when we found out he had had a stroke. This happened again in almost exactly the same way about 8 years later when they came to visit again. The second time in our house was I think his 3rd or 4th stroke so at that point he was unfortunately a shadow of his former self. But the first one he had there were no signs or indications that he would have a stroke or another health related illness. He was diabetic and did drink a lot which whilst my dad does drink a bit it isn‚Äôt an abhorrent amount and he isn‚Äôt a diabetic (has no illnesses as far as I‚Äôm aware) 

He has gone to hospital after the ambulance came to pick him up, it took a while and they didn‚Äôt originally want to come and get him because my area has limited ambulances and they are all on call for COVID-19 cases. They have run blood tests, pressure tests, an X-ray and general examination and as of yet nothing has come back to indicate anything happened at all. Which has left us all extremely confused and a little bit worried that there‚Äôs some underlying thing that has been undiagnosed. 

Thinking the worst my mum has been rattled since then for understandable reasons, as am I but not the same extent, as she thought she had just watched the man she loves pass away in front of her. So being the smart and inquisitive person she is she has been researching everything under the sun for a possible explanation for what happened. She‚Äôs come to the conclusion of a TIA, but neither of us or anyone we know are doctors and though we have experience with helping my grandad through multiple strokes (my mum was both times the one to call the ambulance for him) we are by no means experts when it comes to the sings, symptoms and identification of strokes or stroke like illnesses. So I was hoping people on here would be able to help us out theorising what might have happened to him and also on what to look out for in the coming days. I‚Äôm a 24 year old guy studying my masters at home due to the pandemic so I‚Äôm petrified about losing my dad early, I‚Äôd like him to be around to become a grandad to the children I will hopeful one day have. 

Thanks for your help.

Edit: something that I forgot to mention before, when I came downstairs when my mum was screaming my name he didn‚Äôt seem to understand the magnitude if what had happened and why everyone seemed concerned and upset. He was just saying don‚Äôt worry I just fell asleep go  back to bed, which clearly wasn‚Äôt the case since my mum was slapping his face really hard and he wasn‚Äôt responding. It took probably about 1,5 hours for him to stop resisting our help and not dismissing his need for medical attention. I got my youngest brother to go upstairs away from everyone and call and ambulance and when they came having asked him, my mum and my dad some questions, he went without any resistance but it took a long time of persisting with him that he needed immediate medical attention for him to be receptive to the idea.

He did not have the typical TIA, it was in its pons. A blockage in a different section of the brain can result in different way of showing. E.g. the TIA in the pons has more effect on the intestines.

My husband had a stroke in May of last year due to A Fib. Immediately after the stroke he was unable to talk or walk and had issues with toileting. These have all gotten better. He can talk, although sometimes he will struggle for a word a little or call something by a weird name (like calling the kennel the ‚Äúdog house‚Äù or saying he‚Äôs going to the ‚Äúfilling station‚Äù instead of the gas station). He had been laid off from his job in March due to Covid, and then tried to start working at a very simple job in a storage facility in September, but made too many mistakes and could not handle it. 

To the outsider he looks completely normal. He has no limp, facial drooping, anything like that. He will, however, often cry for hours on end (the first times I have EVER seen him cry and we‚Äôve been married for 15 years), will get irritated, is very sleepy, and just overall depressed. He will also get this thousand yard stare and has major issues following simple instructions (like a grocery store list or a recipe). I find myself getting frustrated because I am financially supporting the family and even I sometimes ‚Äúforget‚Äù his limitations. Are these cognitive issues ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?  When we had a follow up visit with a neurologist a few months ago they gave him tests like looking at a picture and naming what animal it was, but nothing that really showed his current cognitive issues.

‚Äì Unknown

So often we're categorized by how we answer the question, ""Is the glass half full or half empty?"" If you answer that it's half full, you're an optimist. If you answer that it's half empty, you're a pessimist.

Some days we will view the glass as either half empty or half full, depending on our mood and perception of the day.

In reality, we have the opportunity to move from a passive viewer to an active participant in our life. We can refill our own glass when we change our mindset from ""letting things happen to us"" to ""taking control."" 

We build resilience.

It's the same bullshit as people telling stroke survivors, **""But you don't look sick.""**

What they didn't see were the **sleepless nights** of panic attack after panic attack. They didn't see me struggling with **hyperventilation** during my final chemistry exam. They didn't know that **I couldn't leave** my immediate city for fear that there wouldn't be a hospital nearby in case I had a panic attack.‚ÄãIt took me years to get my mental health under control and to become comfortable with talking about it. Now, I share freely because, although I know there will still be those that judge, **we must start having real conversations about invisible problems.**

Mental health, fatigue, and cognition changes after stroke are the invisible issues that survivors often deal with. It can be really hard to have conversations about these areas that others can't see. There's a lot of stigma and shame surrounding the invisible issues.

But the only way to combat the stigma is to **normalize our experiences**.

Let's try to be open about the way we feel and think. In that openness, the healing process can continue.

Mine has since been patched and so the risk of future stroke is gone."", 'Hi johnwes40,\n\nI have almost the same story with the vision.  I had a couple of episodes earlier in the year when I lost the right side of my vision for an hour or so.  I had no idea what it was, and it didn\'t occur to me that it might be a stroke symptom.  Being ""only"" 41, stroke wasn\'t really on my radar.  I did see an optometrist the next day after the last one, who said I had high eye pressure and to see my doctor.    Anyway soon after that I had a proper stroke.  At first it just seemed like dizziness and really bad balance, and I was so tired I just went to bed and tried to sleep.  The next morning I got to hospital and after a lot of poking and prodding and a few scans, they said I\'d had an ischaemic stroke on my left middle cerebral artery, and that the scans showed evidence of older strokes.  I wonder if that\'s what those episodes of vision problems were?  (I didn\'t really get to discuss it with the doctors.)\n\nIn hindsight I wish I\'d been more aware of the connection between vision and stroke.  And also that I\'d gone to hospital immediately when they could have given me emergency blood-clot-dissolvers or whatever, instead of sleeping on it.\n\nIt\'s good that you seem be mostly unaffected apart from your vision.  Is your vision recovering?  Mine seems fine now.  I lost some right-side coordination in my big stroke, which still affects me *especially* if I\'m tired, making me walk a bit funny.  That\'s really the only physical symptom.  My main problem is I get tired easily and can\'t really concentrate.  I think writing this is the biggest feat of concentration I\'ve managed in the last 2 months!\n\nThe symptoms seem to come and go and like you I wonder if they\'re going to suddenly change.  I don\'t want to have more little episodes without knowing if they\'re strokes and whether to call an ambulance.  The basic advice from the hospital is to call one if there are any *new* symptoms.', ""I am sorry to hear that you had a stroke.  My boyfriend had a stroke on 10/13/20 at the age of 39. I am not a doctor but I feel like I am very knowledgeable with several family members in the medical field and have to care for immediate family members with heart attacks, internal bleeding, you name it website experienced it. When this was all happening to my boyfriend  he first lost vision like you did in his right eye. He had no other symptoms of a stroke. A couple of hours later he started to seem a little off and had symptoms  that were similar to his sugar dropping; he's diabetic.  A few hours later, he was in the shower got dizzy, nauseous, and felt weak in the legs. And a few more hours after that is when I knew his issues were a little more serious. It wasn't till I woke up to a banging noise to only find him standing in the coat closet asking me where he was, where was I, why did I leave him and where is the bathroom. He then wasn't able to hold himself up. I begged him to go to the ER and he fought me for an additional 8 hours before he finally let me take him. This was happening from 7pm till 12pm the following day. \n\nWhen we got to the hospital I was treated like I was at fault cause I should have known this was a stroke and to call 911. I don't understand how they can even give me a hard time when his symptoms were not all present at the same time and were all extremely delayed.  So, yes, its possible for stroke symptoms to be delayed. \n\nMay I ask how your vision is today? Are you able to drive? We were told by the neuro ophthalmologist that his current vision state is what it is. I don‚Äôt agree and we are going for a second opinion. I hope his vision improves if not I don‚Äôt know what the future holds. We are already dealing with sever depression from this. üòï""]",371
371,OT Quick Tip: Brush Your Teeth!,13,krp37h,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/krp37h/ot_quick_tip_brush_your_teeth/,2,"I mentioned yesterday that a combination approach of exercise and activities is an effective and free way to improve hand function. 

**But how can you actually make activities a part of your recovery?** 

Find ways to challenge yourself with daily activities. 

* Practice holding onto your toothbrush with your affected hand while you brush your teeth.  
* Try to screw off the toothpaste cap with your affected hand. 
* Wash the opposite side of your body as best you can with your affected arm. 
* Reach up or down into kitchen cabinets to get a pot, cup, or snack.
* Hold onto a pen even if you can‚Äôt write. 

Your brain needs repetition to reorganize! The more you can use your affected arm and hand in daily activities, like brushing your teeth, the better.

Questions and answers that can be somewhat foreboding to seek out on your own (if you're anything like me that is), so I thought we as a community could begin the process of compiling our own ""one-stop-shop"" so to speak.

I was thousands of miles away from home and I thought my life was over when I came to the next day in hospital and my body wasn‚Äôt the same. I had Left Side Aphasia, slurred speech, horrendous memory and not able to walk. I also get random pins and needles pain shooting up and down my back when I have been straining myself too much or a feel another relapse coming on.
I returned home having to use a wheel chair and get used to life with no use of my left side.
After countless CT/MRI scans, neurology appointments where doctors were confused by what else has cause my long term effects - I still had no physio department willing to help me as ontop of the Subarachnoid haemorrhage diagnoses I have also been diagnosed with Motor Function Disease.
At this point I was ready to give up but then I realised I could do the research and build a fitness plan to gain back the ability to walk. 
1 year later, I taught myself how to walk again . I am out of a wheel chair and crutches walking with a Boxia Foot Support which gives me control over my drop foot. My speech has came back to almost normal (ironically I can‚Äôt say the word neurological still hahah) and I am building my left side strength back with excessive balls and weights. 

Now I am 21 and life is different as I still suffer relapses in form of TIA‚Äôs but I am at a stage where I am enjoying life again. The most satisfying feeling was the first time I walked around the block without any aid such as crutches or a wheel chair-very emotional but so proud of myself for getting to this day. 

You may just be days after a stroke or perhaps even a month and think you are stuck in a wheel chair or unable to say your name without stuttering.

After an operation to save her life she came out of a coma a few days later with life changing results. She struggled to talk, didn‚Äôt recognise her grandchildren and couldn‚Äôt move her right side.

We were told these were sadly going to be permanent problems. My mum, who spent her career caring for people who had suffered brain injuries from road accidents and strokes among other things had an incredibly thought battle ahead of her.

With the help of my wonderful father, who spent every second possible by her side, she began to fight back.
She can now talk, with difficulty, but can communicate with us. She can walk. Her right leg is week, but she refuses to give up. She is working so hard with her right arm, and the joy on her face when she recently picked up a cup of tea with her right hand and proudly showed us was a beautiful moment.

**Yesterday**

She works in a hospital and suddenly collapsed, but people saw and she was given tPA medication within 30 minutes. She was unable to speak and her right side was paralyzed, but she was seemingly making facial expressions to her boss and colleagues that indicated she understood them.

Then they sent her to a hospital 5 minutes away where a doctor removed the blood clot from her left brain (one of the central arteries). Soon after this, she regained motion in her right side again.

They did cognitive checks every hour on her, during one of which she said ""go back"", which the nurse didn't feel made much sense, so she speculated there could be expressive *and* receptive aphasia. 

In the late hours of the evening she kept saying ""don't tell family"", which the nurse relayed to me and I confirmed that she has historically said that whenever we go to a hospital or doctor. Her personality might still be in-tact. The adrenaline of hope has strengthened me.

---

**Today**

She walked with a physical therapist today, and a speech pathologist cleared her for eating normal physical food, so no dysphagia thankfully.

They had her try to write her name and she struggled.

They finally let me speak to her on the phone and I told her how amazing she was, how she has this, and that we all love her so much. She tried to say something to me that started with ""Can you..."", but she never managed to finish the sentence.

I dropped off an iPad and iPhone after finally being cleared by the nurse, hoping to God she could just text her thoughts. I haven't received any messages, so I'm scared that ability is gone, too. I texted her ""Hi"" and am waiting for literally anything at all.

---

**Tomorrow**

They will do an Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) at 1 PM and find out if she has a hole in the heart that allowed the clot to go through to the brain.

---

**Things I don't know**

* Will she ever be able to speak again?
* Will she walk, write, do yoga like she used to?
* Will she need a new heart?
* Will she be able to do the things she loves? Listen to music? Cook? Chill with the dogs?
* Will she be able to resume her activities as a manager? 
* Should I do the paperwork for a leave of absence and apply for disability?

She's such an amazing person and I don't want to lose any part of her, and I'm so scared and don't know what to do. In between the phone calls with family and the hospital, I'm stuck with my own mind, and I can't think positively about this. I need some sort of sign, some sort of assurance that it's going to be okay.

So i‚Äôm writing this two weeks after my mom having a severe bleeding in the brain and almost not making it. My whole life has turned upside down and yesterday the doctor said that in cases like the one my mom has gotten the damage on the brain could be so bad that she will never be able to speak again. And it hurts so bad, i‚Äôm 22m and my mom is turning 48 on monday. I‚Äôm posting this here because i‚Äôm scared and sad I will never get my mom back.

But as right now they don‚Äôt know how severe the damage is on the brain, she‚Äôs been in an medical coma for two weeks after the operation where they took out the blood that had been filling up in there. They say she‚Äôs young and that‚Äôs a positive because she has a bigger chance to get her speech and movement back with training, but i‚Äôm terrified she won‚Äôt be able to talk ever again. I just want my mom back, there‚Äôs so much stuff we haven‚Äôt done yet together, and I miss her at home every day. Dad is also heartbroken. I felt like I needed to write this somewhere where maybe more people have gone through the same awful thing. I still have hope and pray she will push through this, but it‚Äôs still so sad and hurts.

384,My stroke,14,c1klst,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/c1klst/my_stroke/,16,"Hi all,

I had a stroke when I was 13, it affected the right side of my body, it wasn't one of the 3 major types of strokes (ichemic, TIA, or hemorrhagic). My left MCA just shrunk down to the point where only one blood cell could fit through at a time. (Single file line type deal) Since it happened near my temple, my speech center was also interrupted. So for the first couple of days I was mute, then I started talking, but with aphasia. This affected my writing as well as my speaking, and I have seen great improvements over the years. I went through learning how to walk again, run again, use my left hand for writing (and pretty much everything). I used a Saebo for my hand to help it get better, the tone was and still is a lot, especially when I get excited. I got back to playing soccer, with a new kicking leg (bc you are dead wrong if you think a stroke will stop me). I loved playing videogames before my stroke, and so I found a way to play them using 1 hand on a normal controller (read the above reasoning for why). I never really had depression, I'm not sure why. I try not to dwell on things I can't do, I figure out ways to do them. Fast forward 8 years, I'm going into my senior year of college, on track to get a degree in Exercise Science, which I will then use to get my Doctorate of Physical Therapy. I have found a love for helping people, and want to pay the same care given to me forward. Yes, most of my life is consumed with figuring out how this could have happened and how to get better. I have found hope in cannabis, this allows me to take leaps I couldn't dream of before (using a mouse). Yes, I know the risks of using cannabis and frankly I don't care. I want my life back dammit, and I'm not going to let a stroke take that away, I'd rather regain use of my body and get dementia then just sit here mopey. 

This isn't my whole story, just snippets, but it's 3 am and I needed to get this off of my chest. Feel free to contact me if need be.

386,15 Home Modifications You Should Make after a Stroke,13,bwoe8k,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/bwoe8k/15_home_modifications_you_should_make_after_a/,0,"Stroke survivors often experience problems with their walking, coordination, and balance, which can greatly impact their ability to live comfortably and safely in their homes. The clinical implications of a stroke can also increase a person‚Äôs risk of falling and getting injured post-attack.

Nevertheless, even with the various physical, cognitive, and emotional [issues that stroke may cause](https://www.stroke.org/we-can-help/survivors/stroke-recovery/post-stroke-conditions/), it‚Äôs still possible for survivors to live independently in their own home ‚Äî if the right home modifications are implemented to encourage the patient‚Äôs recovery, enhance their safety at home, and generally offer them an improved lifestyle.

## Why Home Modifications Are Important Following a Stroke

The goals of modifying a home after stroke should be:

* To install essential assistive devices in the patient‚Äôs home
* To improve home safety
* To reduce the patient‚Äôs risk of falling at home

In short, your goal should be living in their home more manageable for the stroke survivor.

Of course, this means that you‚Äôll need an expert who‚Äôs well-versed with making home modifications for stroke survivors. They will be able to assess your loved one‚Äôs needs and make changes that best fit their specific situation.

For your part, you should look around, watch your loved one as they move around, and find ways in which you can increase their independence, safety, and overall comfort level.

## Common Post-Stroke Home Modifications

The following are suggestions for some of the modifications you can make to help your loved one.

**In the Bathroom**

* Install handrails in the shower or bathtub as well as beside the toilet
* Install non-slip bath mats
* Install single-lever faucets that can be operated easily using one hand
* Install toilet chairs and shower or bathtub benches
* Install a handheld showerhead
* Install swing-clear door hinges that offer enough room for a wheelchair or walker to pass through

**In the Bedroom**

* Install bed rails on the bed
* Use bed risers to raise a low bed. Conversely, if the bed is too high, lower it

**In the Kitchen**

* Install pull-out shelves or use baskets in place of traditional shelves
* Increase cabinet access by installing a lazy Susan
* Provide a small, wheeled cart for carrying groceries and other kitchen supplies

**Other General Changes**

* Have a cordless phone installed in every room
* Get rid of throw rugs and use double-sided tape to hold carpets down to the floor
* Keep floors clear, and ensure that there‚Äôs enough space for your loved one to maneuver around the house without bumping into things.
* Ensure that the house is adequately lit ‚Äî especially along the hallways, doorways, and in the bathrooms.

[Stroke affects people differently](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/stroke/effects-of-stroke). For some, it‚Äôs not always easy to adjust to life afterwards. This is why it‚Äôs particularly important that the survivor returns home to an environment that not only supports continuing recovery but also increases their safety. To ensure your home is ideal for recovery, consider working with a Certified Aging in Place Specialist who can guide you through the process.

I was a little afraid of going back... like what if doing something there resulted in the blood clot that led to my stroke (I'm still waiting on some test results but as of now the cause is still unknown). But my energy levels are back and the cold I've had for the past week is easing up so I really should start getting back into it. But I'm choosing to wait until after my job interview tomorrow. Because a part of me things that anything can lead to another stroke for me and I would really like the possibility of getting a job offer if I could.... 

&#x200B;

I feel like my mom is starting to blame me for the whole thing now (i don't know if that's true it's just how I feel), I mean I don't smoke, I'm not obese, I have a few health issues like pcos and crohns... I'm not very active besides workouts. But she's been complaining all morning about the way I eat and how I'm always in my bed and I won't workout.

&#x200B;

When I do workout sometimes its 30mins sometimes it's an hour or 90 mins it ranges because my priority is going and feeling mentally fine with returning the next day. Whenever I come home she's always like oh you were only there for an hour? Then why go?.... And as far as how I eat.... I eat healthy cereal but mostly dry and a lot of eggs and grapes and vegetables/beans or meat on average there's nothing really BAD about that....

My artery broke and squished the other artery. No one (including my doctors) really has any experience with a cerebellar stroke. Part of my cerebellum is gone. I didn‚Äôt lose any muscle control, become paralyzed, or have speech issues. But because the cerebellum controls balance, some motor skills, and some speech, that‚Äôs where my issues are. I have severe balance issues. I have the physical strength to walk, but even the slightest terrain change makes me lose my balance. Most of my other issues have resolved. I was in a rehab hospital for a month, where I regained some of my mental and physical skills. I‚Äôm working on getting a therapy dog to help me balance and to help me in crowds. My brain still has trouble processing multiple things at once (loud noises, smells, lots of people, too much to look at) and I have trouble navigating crowds or stores without someone‚Äôs help. I am very easily overwhelmed by stimuli and I lose my balance and ability to think/speak well sometimes. Does anyone have experience with a cerebellar stroke? No one can tell me my long term prognosis. All I really get is ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably always have balance issues.‚Äù I know I am lucky it was not worse but it is still devastating emotionally and physically.

A coil procedure would not work to treat this type of aneurysm so they had to sacrifice the artery (PICA) by using a glue, thus intentionally causing a stroke to his left cerebellum. He‚Äôs about 8 months out now and it‚Äôs been a long road. He was in the ICU for 3 weeks, having to undergo an emergency craniectomy due to swelling from the cerebellar stroke.  He also had severe and diffuse vasospasms, which kept him in the ICU, sedated and on a vent. It was uncertain if he would survive and if he did, what that would look like. He had to spend another 3 weeks in the hospital with a trach and feeding tube bc he couldn‚Äôt come off of the ventilator. So he had a late start on rehab bc he had to be able to breathe on his own before being admitted to inpatient rehab. He did inpatient rehab for 4 weeks, and upon discharge home he immediately started an outpatient neuro program that was 5 days/week. He did that for almost 4 months before moving to outpatient PT a few times a week. \nHis biggest issues were double vision and a distorted visual field, difficulty swallowing, and balance. All of these issues have greatly improved, but when he starts getting tired they worsen. He‚Äôs also developed some really bad left facial and eye pain that is looking more and more like they are central pain (caused by the brain). He has issues w sensory and temperature sensory on his right side and feels like he‚Äôs split down the middle. \nHe has the same issues with sensory overload. He‚Äôs great one-on-one, but he struggles following group conversation. This is typical post-stroke from what I‚Äôve learned. The brain is creating new pathways and takes longer to route all of the info coming in. That‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt multitask like he used to. \nThe other big issue he has is central sleep apnea caused by the stroke. We knew that neuro-fatigue was a real thing and he was having such a hard time w energy. We finally realized that he was only breathing around 4-5 times/hour when asleep. He‚Äôs now on a bipap machine that will also ventilate him through the face mask in order to maintain a normal respiratory rate while he sleeps. \nHe‚Äôs able to work from home now. He can drive, but he doesn‚Äôt drive far. It‚Äôs too much for him to drive in heavy traffic or far distances. \nHis balance continues to improve, so don‚Äôt believe anyone who sets limits on your recovery. You are young and you are very fresh from your stroke. Keep working at it and don‚Äôt stop looking for the help you need to get better. Educate yourself as much as possible. \nThis has been such a hard thing to adjust to in the prime of our lives, but we can‚Äôt give up hope that he will continue to get better. Outwardly he looks very good for what he‚Äôs gone through, but that makes it harder bc others don‚Äôt see or understand all of the struggles that aren‚Äôt as visible. Some people are caring enough to see the struggle and some people are just a*holes and too self-centered to bother. Try not to let them get you down.

His was caused by long term high blood pressure that net unregulated (regular physicals, people!!) and his recovery and challenges sound very similar to yours. \n\nFirst, I am so sorry that you went through this. Because a lot of your challenges are not obvious to someone on the outside, I imagine it can be challenging. I know my dad struggles to keep up with his old pace and others expectations (he looks fine so people who know him feel like he‚Äôs ‚Äúhealed‚Äù and he is not great about speaking up when he needs to rest and take it easier or is overwhelmed. He struggles a lot in loud restaurants and to be able to focus on a conversation when there are other conversations going on around him. Do not hesitate to make your needs known. People who love you are happy to accommodate your new needs, whether that is choosing a less loud restaurants, or getting seats instead of lawn tickets to a concert because you can‚Äôt navigate the terrain of the lawn seating anymore.

If anything, they are looking for ways to help, so if you can identify things that will help you, they are happy to be able to make your life a bit easier in practical ways! \n\nIf you are the type of person who tends to downplay your challenges, especially to a doctor, bring someone close to you with you to appointments so they can make sure you don‚Äôt tell your dr you‚Äôre doing ‚Äúfine‚Äù when there are areas you wish could improve. Be honest with your dr. My dad was having a lot of dizziness a certain time of day even after 9 months and the dr had him change his blood pressure meds which vastly improved his dizziness! Please please be honest with your dr so they can best help you.\n\nConsider seeing a therapist or joining a support group (I wish my dad would do this!) what you went through was traumatic and life changing. Do not neglect your mental health as you mourn what you have lost and work through what your new normal is. Life, even with challenges, is beautiful. If you feel discouraged or depressed, be honest with people who love you. \n\nRemember Recovery is not linear and you may make significant progress for awhile and then level off for a bit, with more progress months later. Research shows even 2 years later improvement can be seen. \n\nPractical advice - The wii fit balance board thing is a good way to stay up on PT and keep working on your balance! And don‚Äôt feel bad if you‚Äôre horrible at it,  I am horrible too and haven‚Äôt had a stroke!

He does need to rest more (can‚Äôt handle a 12 hour work day but plans his work schedule now for afternoons to be office work instead of field work). He also is driving again but has a lifetime handicap pass so he does not have to walk as far which helps with his stamina over the course of the day.

I have nothing to compare my recovery to, so I have no idea what has worked and what hasn‚Äôt as far as rebuilding my brain but I can at least tell you what I think makes me feel better. Maybe it‚Äôll give you something to try.  I was a moderate meditator before but now I (almost) always do a half or 3/4 hours a day. I like the guided meditation for stroke recovery by the Monroe Institute. I bought a good pair of headphones and listen to Mozart violin and piano concertos for about two hours a day. It calms the noise in my head and makes me feel much better. I try to get my heart rate up either walking or now bicycling for about an hour a day. I find that is almost the best therapy of all. I feel like Somehow the rushing blood through my brain flushes out the toxins of dying cells or something. That‚Äôs how I visualize it anyway. I just know it makes me feel better. Maybe you could use a treadmill until your balance returns. And I think it will in time. For balance I put a surfboard in the living room and a foam block underneath, standing on it while listening to Mozart on the headphones. I think what‚Äôs happening with the classical music is that it organizes the noise so your brain can rewire your balance centre. Also I bought a 620nm red light and use that for a half hour a day.

My dad (72) had a cerebellar stroke 23 days ago. We missed the 4 hour mark getting him to the hospital. He was drooling so much that he ended up getting a minor lung infection and had to be intubated because he couldn't breathe on his own. He couldn't be weaned off the ventilator after 2 tries at extubation. 18 days since the stroke, he got a tracheostomy. So far, he seems to be doing okay breathing on his own while given 30% oxygen. Not sure exactly how it works, but the nurses said that he is not on the ventilator during the day, only at night. They did a CT scan on him and found that the additional bleeding in the middle of his brain seemed to have stopped (and might've been caused by the blood thinners they've been administering from day 1), but the initial infarction of the first stroke has deepened. They resumed giving him blood thinners after the trach operation.   


Since the day he was admitted, he has been doing minor PT and has been able to move his hands and legs. However he is still on a lying down position. When he was admitted, he had slurring of speech but was able to write in his own handwriting, telling us what to do. I asked about when they would introduce more intense PT and even OT/ST but haven't received much info. The nurses tell me that they do minor PT for less than an hour each day. 

Some questions I have: While being on the trach, is it too early to introduce speech therapy? I am worried that my dad can't swallow or speak next time if he doesn't start soon. Also, should I be advocating harder for more aggressive therapy? I haven't been able to see him since day 1 because of covid. Will the absence of family affect his recovery?

My mother was hospitalized (about 20 days) because of a heart valve problem. She had a Smartphone with her and EVERY day we talked to her and comunnicaded about everything. Every sunday and wednesday one family member could visit her and yesterday i went to the hospital.

She felt great and happy! We had a great conversation about almost everything anyone could think, she was so happy because i visited her and was about 3 weeks without seeing me personally.

At about the end of the time span that visits can stay, she decides to eat some ""hospital lunch"" that a nurse gave to her, then her proceeds to drop a bag with what i think it was wrapped bread. I pick up to the ground, open the plastic bag, clean the wrap ( which was not dirty by any means) and gave to her.

In this moment what i saw was not my mother, she seemed so confuse and yet so aware at the same time, i cant explain. She had the same conscious pattern a drunk person have.

I asked: Mom, are you ok? She said, with a groggy face and  voice: Yes im fine. I said: You are definnetly not ok, why are you lying? Please, what are you feeling? And she said: im fine, boy. What are talking.  Thats just the way i speak.

It happened so fast, 1 hour and 40 minutes prior she was laughing and gesturing and etc and then she was another person. It broke me.

I proceed to call the nurses and she kept saying: im fine, im fine. Giving thumbs up to me.

The did some test in this moment asking for her to smile, something that really broke me because them i noticed it was a stroke because i helped to treat my grandpa when he had it. She couldnt move her left arm and leg. They tell me to wait outside and it was the worse 30 minutes of my life.

They tell me that she had a stroke and she would be transfered to another floor, i saw her unconsious. And they tell me to call the next day.

My sister calls and they said she had hemorradic stroke and more than half of her brain got damaged and they needed more 48 hours so they can do more exams and everything.

I just dont know what do think anymore, i dont know if i said anything that could trigger this, im crying every single minute, i love my mom so much and that 2 hours i had with her could be the last.
Im very scared that she cant talk or be desabilited for the rest of her life.
She was a very active, speaker person.

401,My dad (59m) had a stroke. Day 4,12,pvq7qm,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/pvq7qm/my_dad_59m_had_a_stroke_day_4/,30,"My dad (59m) had a stroke Thursday of this week. I've been glancing on reddit to find stores/experiences from others for comfort. It's been really hard to be on my phone bc I want to give him my undivided attention. 

At 11AM on Thursday (September 23rd, 2021) my dad had the ""droopy"" face while working at someone's house (license electrician and owns his own company). The family knew what was happening and rushed him to the emergency room. Luckily they were close to one of the best hospitals in the country and he was immediately put in. Surgery lasted about 4 hours. They found a blood clot on the left side of his head towards the back. 

At the time I was in school (college: MLT student) and didn't get a call until about 2:40 right when I left school. His wife called me and said they had trouble finding relatives for him because all he had was his I.D but no one was home at the home address(I don't live with him and his wife was at work). 

The first day was the absolute hardest. He was not able to talk or move. He could only squeeze his left hand. They were not able to get the clot in his head and said they wouldn't try again because it was too dangerous. The next day or so they found several more blood clots in his leg and preformed a procedure to put mesh wiring in to help collect the clots before they reach his lungs, heart, or head. 

By day three he was able to walk with assistance, can sit, and even pick up a comb (can't brush his hair yet). He can eat mashed foods fairly well, but gets really tired after about 10 minutes of eating.He still can't speak but can make grunt sounds to communicate and can shake his head yes or no. He understands small questions fairly well but can't recognize pictures yet.

Prior to all of this he was seen by a doctor two months ago with leg pain (inner thigh). I use to work in vascular so I knew what it was. His PCP tried to dismiss it as a muscle infection but I insisted the ultrasound tech do a bilateral on his legs. Sure enough they found a clot and he was put on blood thinners. He was also already on medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol. He is also a heavy smoker.

Everything was lining up to a stroke and I wish I knew sooner. I know better. They did an EKG to find his heart flutters (I forgot what it's called) but it's also linked to having a stroke. 

Something else that scares me is when they did an x-ray they found a mass on his lung. They lightly said it but I already know what it is. They haven't tested for it yet but ik it's lung cancer. They said they won't worry about it until 2 weeks or so because they want him more stable from the stroke. 

Every day is really hard. Today is day 4. I can't stop crying and I feel so guilty if I'm not there with him. I've been with him every day, and called out of work and school. Tuesday I start my midterms and practicals that are not optional to miss so idk if I'll be able to see him for 3 days and it KILLS me inside. His wife will be with him so he's not alone but I'm so scared something is going to happen when I can't be there.

This was really for me to let it all out. I feel so lost and hurt idk what to do. I've never experienced something like this with a family member before. I'm just thankful he's at one of the best hospitals and I know he's in good care. Idk what to expect for his future though. I'm scared he won't be able to talk again or be the same. 

The last time I saw him he was helping me with my car and I remember him giving me a big hug and kissing me on the cheek. I will never forget that day as long as I live.",2021-09-26 09:00:59+00:00,"['I‚Äôm sorry your family is going through this. It‚Äôs hard. \n\nThere will be better times, you are early days atm.

He may have difficulty with listening comprehension, reading comprehension, written expression, and talking/speech. This is treated with an SLP. He also likely has right sided weakness. PT and OT will work on him getting around and doing daily activities independently again. It‚Äôs important to know that the first 6 months are the biggest time for spontaneous recovery and progress. Typically the most progress is seen in those first 6 months of stroke recovery. After that, progress can certainly still be made. It just typically isn‚Äôt seen in large steps any more.

I do want to echo what another commenter said and what my dad‚Äôs nurses told us: he is young! And his brain is still elastic, and that definitely helps with gaining back functions.

It was comforting to read the stories of others who have been through this on this subreddit so thank you. üôè

We're now at the stage of trying to figure out what happened and what to do going forward. Doctors so far have been unable to find any explanation for the stroke. One of my biggest concerns regarding it is my dad's diet. He has a lung disease (MAC) and struggles to keep his weight up. The best advice his doctors have been able to give him in the past 2 years has been to eat a lot of sugar before he goes to bed. While I can accept this as a short term weight gain solution it seems insane and semi-suicidal to continue on this regiment indefinitely. He has diabetes and has struggled with fatigue and depression his whole life; introducing more sugar into his diet seems like a terrible idea to me. I've been researching this subject lately, most recently reading the book ""Grain Brain"" which goes into how sugar, carbs, and gluten are actually huge contributors to brain diseases like dementia, alzheimer's, and strokes. This has me extra concerned about the sugar-diet plan laid out by his doctors.

How have you and/or stroke survivors you know dealt with their diet after the stroke? Any suggestions on diets to keep his brain healthy while also keeping his weight up?

The connection between high blood sugar and stroke would have me getting another opinion or two from different nutritionists. After my own stroke, I‚Äôve focused on lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables. A lot of the diets that are low in carbs and sugars replace them with fat, which can be equally dangerous for someone at risk of certain types of stroke.

We don‚Äôt know for sure. She has elected no life sustaining measures after her first stroke resulted in total paralysis of her left side of her body and severe back pain. She‚Äôs been in skilled nursing.  However, her symptoms are consistent with those strokes we had confirmed via imaging when this nightmare started. 

This last apparent stroke has rendered her unresponsive and non-verbal. Her entire body is locked up. She refused food and drink verbally the first day, and no longer responds verbally or non verbally.  She‚Äôs had no food or drink for 4 days.  She‚Äôs no longer making urine. She‚Äôs dying.

Can anyone hazard a guess as to what she‚Äôs perceiving?  I‚Äôve been talking to her, said my goodbyes a few times already, promised to raise my son the best way I can, and apologized for a big rift we had for two years and told her that I love her.

I didn't lose any mental capacity, so the recovery options I'm looking for are mostly physical. The major problem I have is ""drop foot."" I can get around fairly alright, but because of drop foot, I walk with a sort of limp and I routinely (and quickly) destroy the toe on my right shoe. My first question is this: Will physical therapy help me learn to defeat this opponent? I know that approximately 600,000 American suffer a first stroke annually, and while I realize that not everybody suffers from drop foot after suffering a stroke, I'm certain that a large number do. Yet I never see people walking like I do, so this leads me to believe that some sort of rehab/therapy must be effective. I'm very interested in reducing this problem as much as possible. While I'm in no way looking to run a marathon or 5k (similar to my desires pre-stroke,) I would like to be able to comfortably mall walk or take a stroll around the park/lake with my wife. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, while proven, effective remedies that you have personally experienced will be treasured. 

My second question regards destroying the toe in my shoes: Could a podiatrist fit a shoe insert to me to temper this problem? 

I just decided to research this topic and I'm thrilled to have found this forum. After spending the first year after the fact feeling sorry for myself and being embarrassed by my situation, I have noticed some small, incremental improvements in my situation.

This can be sort of annoying so I only focus on walking when the foot drop annoys me.', 'Drop foot can be helped with an AFO- ankle foot orthosis.

And  don‚Äôt wear sandals for you could really damage your toes. \n\nBut Physical therapy is a valid option. Think of it has being trained to walk better.

That could be the case but a PT could bring some awareness to where your deficits are.', 'For me the big difference came when I got a brace. The one I had helped with the drop foot enough to make walking comfortable, but not enough to do all the work for me. It was a fabric piece that wrapped around my ankle with two elastics that attached to my shoe in the front of my foot. This made it so that I still needed to work the nerve pathways and muscles unlike some of the sturdier, less flexible options. Mostly, putting in repeated effort to do the thing you currently can‚Äôt do will help it come back.', 'What helped me, was one just getting better. But other than that, if you think about it, drop foot is similar to shin splints, because it\'s the same muscle. So you can use similar exercises. Mine got better on it\'s own with PT. However for shin splints most athletes do some variation of \'duck walking\' the gist of which is you heavily flex that muscle until the brain realizes it needs to do that. So what I did was, using a walker, as parallel bars were of limited usefulness to me,  point your toes out and up, then walk until your feet naturally drop to normal position.

My dad (68) had a hemorrhagic stroke 3 weeks ago and got to hospital quickly. He had surgery and after the surgery he had to be put on a ventilator which he is still on. 

At first they said his right side was weak but responsive, then for a week or so he couldn't move any part of his body, but now he's been able to move his right fingers again. We've seen both his legs move quite a few times, but it's not on our command so we're not sure if spasms or not yet... 

From what I've read I know it's impossible to say what's going to happen, but I would really love to hear from someone who has experience or seen someone else who was unable to move for some time but had some mobility come back... 

also regarding the ventilator, bc of it he can't speak which is another extremely difficult thing for him. He's been trying so hard to mouth words but it's not always easy to understand, and it's ofcourse making him and us really sad that we struggle to communicate. 

Also any tips on how to best support him. He was an extremely active person and it's absolute heartbreaking to see him in this state. The hospital is really good and looking for the best rehabilitation centre to send him to, but i would really like to hear some stories of hope and how it could be possible to improve atleast some...

Spasticity is a type of abnormal, high muscle tone that is velocity-dependent.    
To break it down, high muscle tone essentially means that there is significant tension and tightness in the muscle that makes it challenging to lengthen and stretch. Velocity-dependent means that this tension and tightness is worse with quick movements versus only being present with slow stretching.   
**The Problem:**   
1. The spinal stretch reflex becomes abnormally triggered.   
2. The brain can‚Äôt inhibit the overactive stretch reflex.    
If that all sounds like gibberish, you can check out my recent video, [The Simple Guide to Spasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgS3-lu6_4w&t=4s).  
There are several things you can do to treat spasticity including daily stretching, using splints, certain icing techniques, e-stim, Botox injections, oral medications, and acupuncture/electroacupuncture.

She gets easily confused and she still has some disorientation of time/spatial awareness. Her right eye has a hard time tracking. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure where she will be a year from now.  But still celebrate all the milestones he hits even if you think they‚Äôre small ones. They‚Äôre still huge. Because he‚Äôs working hard to hit those milestones. \n\nRehabilitation tips:\nWhen you‚Äôre in the right program with the right therapist it makes a world a difference. Typically OT and ST will help him with some form of visual tracking and cognition. A great PT can be life changing. \n\nYou can also do home health as well then do an outpatient rehabilitation service. From personal experience we‚Äôve always had bad experiences with home health. So we decided not to go this route. And also I find it hard to stay motivated to do therapy in your own home when you just want to kick it and relax.\n\nTry asking your case manager what are some acute rehabilitation in-network with your insurance. They usually give you a list and do your research from that list. Find an acute in-patient rehabilitation that has a great neuro program. The earlier intervention you do and with the right therapist will help your dad have the greatest outcome. Ask for virtual tours.\n\nIf needed, they have post acute brain injury programs where it‚Äôs basically a transitional living that is neuro based. The premise of those programs are to help them learn a level of independence before returning home. If your dad has behavioral issues this would be the way to go because they would have a team that could help him work those things.\n\nThere are also neuro day programs that are about 4-6 hours M-F and he‚Äôll be able to come home. This is another form of post acute brain injury as well. This combines communal type therapy, so that way your dad if needed connect with others who are going along this journey. Well communal meaning 1-2 other people due to covid. So he can be in a group (1-2 people) for therapy due to covid. Sometimes they‚Äôll teach them how to cook again with different utensils.\n\nVision is also very important as well. Ensure that he gets some form of vision therapy early on. They say the eyes are still trying to heal even 6-9 months after stroke. Most programs offer some for of vision therapy. If he needs it. \n\nDepending on how extensive the damage was expect impulsivity. My mom definitely had impulsive issues which now has greatly improved. It takes time and lots of encouragement. And if he is apathetic that‚Äôs also part of the injury. Post stroke fatigue is real. So if he‚Äôs tired even after brushing his teeth it‚Äôs okay. Visual and auditory senses can also be tiring so if he closes his eyes sometimes it‚Äôs sometimes to tune out the visual. But he‚Äôs still listening. Keep pushing him to keep going. Encouragement is key to recovery. He‚Äôs going to need y‚Äôall‚Äôs support. He‚Äôs doing some hard work. What takes us 1 min will probably take him 30 min but it will get better. Just be patient. He‚Äôs having to work 1000 times more to get those pathways back.\n\nFatigue and endurance will take time for him to get back as well. Mobility for my mom her Achilles heel would be safety/lack of control. Vision also may or may not improve. He may have vision problems. My moms improved up to a point. Her right eye doesn‚Äôt track as well as the left. If he needs to use the wheelchair, get him to use it to help build his endurance. She still has some form of lack of awareness as well which is part of the injury. \n\nIt takes time to recover. Be patient with your dad. And provide him all the resources to get better. Do your research on various neuro programs. Some of them offer mental health services. \n\nMental health is also another key to his recovery. Ensure a program has a good behavioralist to work with him. Because this recovery can be long. I was told about 18-24 months is where you see the most gains. However, they were able to work with people who were able to recover even 9-10 years out. But they say recovery is much slower after that.\n\n*****Words of Advice******\nIt‚Äôs not what you did or didn‚Äôt do.

My stroke impacted my left side mobility, but not speech.', 'Every stroke recovery will be different. The docs will try and tell you after 6 months not much improvement will happen. At least in eyesight from my experience. But I‚Äôve read that things came back even 5 years later. It will be a process for sure but hang in there and like this person said, ‚Äúbe there‚Äù for him. He may not be able to say things but your support will help ease things. Best of luck to your Dad.', 'I had a brain bleed at 21 and had to have open brain surgery, but after the initial bleed my brain reabsorbed a lot of the blood and I recovered a lot of movement. So your dad might also recover a lot during the next few weeks. He is older, so it will probably take longer. Neuroplasticity works wonders, so the best thing for now is to find some speech therapy exercises so his brain rewires.', '  mobility may or may not come back, I had a stroke in July and have left side paraplegia, I was able to recover about 85% function in my left leg, I can move my ankle some but can‚Äôt wiggle my toes or bareweight on my legand I can only lift my left arm somewhat and absolutely no function in my left hand or fingers, I did receive some OT for my fingers but since my fingers are now clenche, therapy is just the therapist stretching out each finger individually, which is excruciating and I was unable to deal with the pain 3 days a week up to 3-5times per da, as much as I would like to regain function in my hand and fingers, I just cannot bare the pain.  He may have to go on short or long term disability and may need to attend therapy sessions to work on trying to get better-occupational therapy, physical therapy speech/cognitive therapy, and stuff like that for a bit.  When I had my strok, th surgeon had to remove my right bone flap to relieve the pressure in my brain, a few months later they replaced it with a titanium plate, then just removed it again last month because I ended up getting a staph infection so they needed to remove it to try and clean out. The infectio, went on IV antibiotics to help clear up the infection too, and will see at the end of the month when my next surgery will be but right now, without the bone flap, I have to wear a helmet to protect my brain since I have no skull on the right to protect it so he may need a series of surgeries.

Her first stroke was eight years ago on her right which after physio she was able to walk with a limp and assistance but wasn't able to use her fingers on her right hand. Now with the second stroke on her left side she is completely bedridden and can't communicate through words at all. She can slightly nod or shake her head for yes or no. 

I think I just need someone to hit me with the realistic answers of what to expect. Like will physio and diet help her get her left side back completely? Will she talk ever again? What's the probability of her having a heart attack or a fatal stroke.

Recovery does NOT stop after that initial healing burst but does slow way down.\n* If they can treat the cause, your chances of an additional stroke or heart attack should be lessened.\n* The only guarantee is if you don't try, you don't get any better usually.\n* Stroke Rehab is a long, frustrating marathon, There is no normal regarding how long things should take.\n\nIt is way too early to guess but thank you for being there for her.  Don't hesitate to ask questions and advocate for her.  Getting her going with OT, PT, and SLP as soon as possible can make a big difference.  Best wishes to you both."", 'Hey there, I\'m an SLP. I\'m really sorry this is happening to you and your mom. :( Also sorry that it\'s not a great healthcare setup where you guys are.\n\nu/Chinthliss summarized your questions really nicely, so I\'ll add what I can from a communication perspective...\n\nYour mom is still considered acute right now, and the brain/healing (and therefore your mom\'s communication symptoms) can change significantly in the days after a stroke. It\'s a good sign, relatively speaking, that your mom is able to shake her head \'no\' and nod \'yes.\' That suggests that she is comprehending what you\'re telling her, which is not always the case for left hemisphere strokes. Though it\'s not ethical for me to ""diagnose"" over the internet, I would suggest going to Tactus Therapy\'s website ([https://tactustherapy.com/aphasia/](https://tactustherapy.com/aphasia/)) and reading about aphasia (difficulty comprehending and expressing language) and apraxia of speech (difficulty getting the words out the way she wants them to, or at all, in some cases), as those are two possibilities for left-hemisphere strokes. An SLP in your area should be able to provide therapy for both conditions as she starts her recovery journey. If there are no SLPs in your area, COVID has opened up a lot of opportunities for virtual therapy, so you can always see if that\'s a more viable option. \n\nI wish you and your mom the very best. ‚ù§Ô∏è', ""It might not ever be perfect, but she will communicate again. \n\nThe rest, it's hard to say. It all depends on the person. \n\n8 years in between is a long time. Go her! My Dad only had 3."", ""I think it's always good to reach out for more info! Trouble is, each stroke is so different and each person is so different that it's hard to give specific answers to your questions without knowing all your mom's details, and I'm not asking for them, because even with all the details it's still impossible to answer those questions with certainty.\n If your public system isn't doing what you'd like, there could be a private system to look into? I've seen elderly folks make really remarkable improvements, I've seen young people make poor improvements, and everything in-between. Three days ago is still pretty recent, more time will bring more answers. Typically we see the most changes within the first couple months. I would advocate for her to be assessed for inpatient stroke rehab if that's available and appropriate. Those professionals may be able to give you more answers than the acute care staff. Strokes caused by blockages have different recovery timelines than those caused by hemorrhages, the latter being slower in the beginning, but can rapidly improve. The former usually being more steady trajectory. \nThere are loads of great resources on the web, strokeengine.ca is one we use in Canada. If she can't communicate with words the staff may try something like a communication board with her. Someone posted one on here not too long ago I'll try and link it. This forum is great for connecting with other caregivers and people with lived experience of stroke;  it may be a good idea to see if you can connect with a support group more local to you to see how they've navigated the system. Again I can only speak to Canada but our heart and stroke foundation has a national closed Facebook group for caregivers and a separate one for survivors. \nWhat you're going through is no doubt quite stressful. I hope you're able to take extra care of yourself during this difficult time. Wishing you more answers and peace!""]",434
434,OT Tip: Does Alcohol Increase or Decrease Stroke Risk?,13,myxpkk,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/myxpkk/ot_tip_does_alcohol_increase_or_decrease_stroke/,4,"For some time, people have said that drinking a small to moderate amount of alcohol could decrease stroke risk.

However, a 2019 study published in The Lancet revealed that this is not the case. It looked at [the relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of vascular disease](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31772-0/fulltext#seccestitle170) (including stroke).

The researchers looked at 500,000 participants and found that those who consumed alcohol did not show any protective qualities when it came to reducing stroke risk. In fact, they found that alcohol intake increased the risk of high blood pressure, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Specifically, researchers found that alcohol intake appeared to directly relate to 8% of ischemic strokes and 16% of hemorrhagic strokes in the male participants of the study.

People often get mad when research findings change the information they've been clinging to for years (e.g., are eggs good or bad for us? We may never know!), but this is what new evidence does. It helps us understand ourselves and the world around us. It also helps us make better recommendations.

So what's the takeaway? 

It's not to say that you can't ever have another drink, but if you're not a drinker, don't start. If you're a moderate or heavy drinker, it may be time to cut back to reduce your stroke risk.

How do you manage your alcohol consumption? 

Personally, I enjoy the occasional glass of wine with my dinner. To keep it under control so I'm not drinking every night, I don't buy more than 1 bottle of wine at a time and only every so often. If I don't keep it in the house, I don't drink it!",2021-04-26 13:30:29+00:00,"[""For me, I think it's bad, as it was a factor in my stroke. 5 Coronas. Feb 26th (Cold time of year).

Last week, my Friday email tip was about results versus excuses. Knowing that there are 1,440 minutes in a day has the potential to significantly limit our excuses for not doing the things we know we need to do.

As someone who struggles with significant anxiety and perfectionist tendencies, recognizing that there are 1,440 moments to start fresh in a day is wildly comforting. If 60 minutes of that time goes by without being productive, I know that I still have hundreds of minutes left in the day.

This applies to recovery as well. If you're having trouble starting a home recovery program, start out by dedicating 5 minutes a day. Out of 1,440 minutes, you can definitely spare 5 minutes. It's about making small changes that add up to big results over time.

Think about how you typically use your 1,440 minutes. Is it serving you well? Or do you think you could make improvements? I know I definitely could!

I'll share my personal goal. I was a very active outdoor walker before the winter, and that habit slid during the colder months. My goal is to walk at least 30 minutes, 5 days per week. So far this week, I've walked at least 30 minutes on 3 days.

They won‚Äôt be just any trainer.\nThe ones I‚Äôve met ‚Äògeek out‚Äô over how fascinating the human body is and will take the time to educate you, give references, guide you away from common pitfalls, and put you on a path to your goals.\n\n-Lastly, I‚Äôd like to mention Recreational Therapy and recreation in general.\nThere very well may be clinics, meets in your area where you can try something new and fun or perhaps something you thought you would enjoy, but didn‚Äôt know how to work around your limitations.\nExamples in my area: golf, biking (there‚Äôs actual an adaptive biking meet coming up where specially made trikes and quads are available), or maybe you‚Äôd enjoy a beginner‚Äôs dance class?\nMy point is finding recreational activities that you enjoy is important and helps you meet new people, gives you something to look forward to, and all while promoting a healthy lifestyle.\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to push out on your bubble.\n\nKeep up the great questions!', 'I know what you mean. Have your thyroid checked.', 'stop eating in the morning, eat after noon and stop by 8 pm/. no snacking!\n\nexercise doing what you are able to, lean on a bed drop to one knee, roll easily on the floor, do leg lifts, crunches if you can, [stretch.Buy](https://stretch.Buy) some flex bans and start with arm curls ans presses, do squats hold onto a counter, as many as you can, increase as you are able.\n\nFor every hour sitting, do a walk around you home, and a set of squats.Just go as low as you can with no pain.Drink water, and bubbly water with zero sugar.Good luck....its a journey you have to start.']",439

I mentioned last week that I spent 4 days in mid-February going through the intensive Certified Stroke Rehabilitation Specialist course. My brain was filled to the brim with new information.

I compiled my tips from last week on 4 lessons I learned from the course into [my new blog article](https://elysenewland.com/articles/lessons-learned). I talk about stroke-specific considerations for executive function, spasticity, proximal stability, and adaptive shoes/clothing!

My goal is not to keep all of this great information to myself so I can be an ‚Äúelite‚Äù therapist. The point is to learn and share! Therapists and survivors alike benefit when we share what we know.

If you learned something from my new article, please feel free to share!   


**tl;dr**

**First lesson:** executive function (difficulty planning, organizing, sequencing). Up to 70% of survivors deal with cognitive changes. It may look like laziness but it's not! Link in the blog to a video on improving cognition. 

**Second lesson:** Spasticity happens because the pathways from the brain to the muscles get interrupted after a stroke. Muscle sensors (muscle spindles) become hyperexcitable and contract leading to increased, sustained muscle tone and spasticity. Prolonged stretching is an evidence-backed approach for treating spasticity. 

**Third lesson:** Core strength and stability are HUGE to improving movement and mobility. Proximal stability for distal mobility. I give examples of three different exercises you can do while seated, one being the desk push. Sit in a stable chair, feet on the ground, and gently push your hands into a table or desk in front of you to activate lower abs. Link to video in blog on scapular exercises. 

**Fourth lesson:** Adaptive clothing and shoe brands. [Nike Flyease](https://www.nike.com/flyease), [Ugg Universal Line](https://www.zappos.com/e/adaptive/brand-spotlight-ugg-universal), and [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/e/adaptive) adaptive clothing/shoes.

443,OT Tip: Cognitive Changes After Stroke,11,lkfyxq,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/lkfyxq/ot_tip_cognitive_changes_after_stroke/,0,"Hi all!

I hope you're well. Typically, I jump right into my tips but I wanted to preface today's tip with some info.

I spent the last 4 days going through the intensive Certified Stroke Rehabilitation Specialist course. This is the only stroke-specific certification for OTs and PTs in the U.S. My brain is full to the brim with new information and I'm really excited to share some of it with you this week!‚Äã

There was a great lecture on executive function changes after stroke. Executive function is made up of the higher-level thinking processes we use to live our daily lives. It includes the ability to problem-solve, plan, set goals, make decisions, and multi-task.

The instructors shared a study that found **up to 75% of survivors** will deal with cognitive changes.

**That's a lot!**

Specifically, executive function changes sometimes look like ""laziness,"" difficulty finishing tasks, being agitated or restless, or saying inappropriate things. It's important to have conversations about these cognitive changes in order to normalize survivors' experiences and help care partners understand.

Now, that's not to say there aren't things you can do to improve and work with these changes‚Äã

I made this video on short-term memory last week before the course, but the concepts apply to executive function, too. [Check it out by clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1mGg81JwaE&t=95s) if you'd like to get some ideas on where to start!",2021-02-15 15:33:33+00:00,[],444

Stage 1: Flaccidity. The goal is to protect the limb. Use positioning strategies to protect joints. Start using mental practice/motor imagery techniques. 

Stage 2: Spasticity develops. Although there is little motor control, keep trying to move the affected limb as much as possible. Avoid learned non-use in prep for future recovery.

Stage 3: Increased spasticity. Can use splints to prevent contractures. Passively range and stretch the affected limb every day. Talk to your doc about meds/Botox injections. Try to limit stress. 

Stage 4: Decreased spasticity. Can use e-stim (under the supervision of a professional). Move the affected limb as much as possible in normal patterns with either assisted or active range of motion.   

Stage 5: Minimal spasticity. Complete active range of motion and strengthening exercises. Focus on normal, controlled movements. Use the affected limb as much as possible in everyday activities. Repetition!   

Stage 6: No spasticity and return of coordination. Continue to focus on active range and strengthening but include exercises or activities focused on gross/fine motor skills. Hone in on more deliberate movements.

451,My mum had a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage 5 weeks ago,12,jz2eyh,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/jz2eyh/my_mum_had_a_subarachnoid_haemorrhage_5_weeks_ago/,11,"Hello,

My mum (58) had a massive subarachnoid haemorrhage exactly 5 weeks ago. 

She started feeling sick in my car, with an headache. She then asked me to stop because she was feeling like she had to throw up. Very soon after that, she started having seizures. I was lucky enough to be very close to an hospital, that i managed to reach in less than 5 mins from the begining of the seizures. Half an hour later the doctor came to me and told me she had a very important cerebral bleed, and that she was going to be immediately transferred to another hospital that has a dedicated neurosurgery unit.

Later that day, they confirmed that my mum had a SAH, that was due to the rupture of an aneurysm of the basilar artery. The aneurism was coiled, and an external ventricular drain.

Few days later, they called us in because she was awake, and breathing on her own. Everyone in the neurosurgery intensive care unit was very surprised and happy to see that. However, couple days later vasospasm kicked in. The doctors said it was quite intense, and it was treated to the best extent possible.

A MR confirmed that the vasospasms resulted in very small but spread out areas of ischemic damage. They say that because of this, it is very hard to predict which kind of permanent damage my mum will have. She was also fitted with a VP shunt, because there was fluid build up.

After 4 weeks in intensive care, she left for the neurosurgery ward. Her response is not very consistent, there are days in which she has her eyes opened, and other when she only reacts to pain. They also said that her abdomen is quite swollen, and this might be interfering with the VP shunt. At the moment they have tried to make it drain more, if this does not work maybe they will have to replace it with a VA shunt.

I'm feeling quite lost, with the COVID situation is even impossible to go and see her, so i wanted to know if there are people here that already went through all this that have tips/comments/remarks/suggestions..

Thanks!",2020-11-22 20:05:45+00:00,"['My mom had a SAH (2 aneurysm ruptures) in ‚Äò05. She is okay now and made a miraculous recovery.

Not sure what I expected today‚Äôs anniversary to be. A party? No. A celebration? No. Maybe just someone to speak with about all the emotions flowing through me at the moment. 

I find the support was abundant when it first happened. Now, can‚Äôt say the same. No one checks up on me. That‚Äôs their flaw. I don‚Äôt reach out for help. That‚Äôs my flaw. 

I have great friends and family. Top notch really. But what was once ‚Äòus‚Äô is now ‚ÄòI‚Äô and that silence is deafening.

She'd had about 6 in the past months and unfortunately this Thursday gone she had a major stroke of both sides of her brain. Apparently she also has a bleed at the bottom of her brain/top of her neck.

Atm she's in a vegetative state, she opens her eyes briefly between sleep cycles, she responds to pain, she groans and she's moving her legs. But otherwise she's unresponsive to anything like name or what not.

I'm due to fly (I live abroad) to see her on Friday and I'm struggling to accept that I've lost my mum. I'm told by family that shes gone and this is what it will be. That the best outcome would be that she goes in her sleep peacefully. But Dr's tell me it's too soon yet to confirm that she won't recover, however, shes had no change in the past 2 days and it's not looking good. One Dr told me it's not a bad idea to come and say goodbye.

I don't know what I'm looking for here, perhaps some help to accept. Perhaps some stories of hope that others have come back from this.. or just information on what has happened. Maybe there is something that I can do when I go back? I've read about playing music and sensory based activities.

**UPDATE:** 

I wish I had a happy ending to update with, but sadly not. I flew back on a Friday to see my mum and to understand the extent of her condition. I was told at first she was making slow progress but then a few hours after I left she took a turn for the worse. The following day they told me she'd begun developing a chest infection (from being sick during one of the strokes) and at that point it was a case of making her comfortable. I was able to be with her (I hope somehow she knew I was there), talk to her, play her videos of her granddaughter and songs I knew she liked. And then on Sunday morning, the 2nd August, she passed away. 

Although I am heartbroken and it's still so raw, I wanted to do an update to let you know what happened, but also to thank those below that took the time to reply with advice and support. I took it all in, particularly u/themcp \- that last bit was exactly what I did. 

So thank you, and good luck to those still healing, pushing thru and searching for advice.

My heart goes out to you and your mom.', 'This response is going to be a little all over the place as I share a number of relevant facts from my experience. If you just want my recommendation, skip to the last paragraph.\n\n* I had six tiny strokes all over my brain so I didn\'t have a similar stroke to your mom. I had a heart attack at the same time.\n* I was unconscious for a week, and I had no memory for several days after that.\n* While I was unconscious friends came and played music to me. Apparently the only thing I responded to was the soundtrack to Hamilton, so they put that on repeat for me. I had never heard it before. I was told this before I got home. When I got home, I was too out of it to listen to it. A few months later I was finally up for it and asked Alexa to play it for me. I hate the soundtrack to Hamilton. OMG, it\'s totally something I hate. I recognize the genius of it, but it\'s completely not my cup of tea. I can only think that what my unconscious brain thought was ""turn off that racket!"" and all I could do is groan so they thought I liked it and kept playing it.\n* They all thought I was going to die, and my father came 1500 miles to say goodbye.\n* Everyone I know came to see me. Everyone. Due to where they\'d had to implant a tube for life support and the fact that it had to be continuously monitored to make sure I didn\'t bleed to death, they had to have my groin uncovered, so everyone I know - family, friends, coworkers, people I\'d been the boss of - all saw my privates hanging out while I was unconscious. \n* Then I woke up. They still all thought I was going to die, but I just kept getting better.\n* Apparently my cousin K, my childhood playmate, came to see me while I was sleeping. I haven\'t seen K in about 15 years. I would really dearly love to see her. I have no recollection of her visit, but I had a dream of hearing her voice and for weeks I held onto that memory, it was very comforting to me.\n* They eventually decided I would probably live a few weeks before I die, but I just kept getting better.\n* They sat me down for a talk to tell me I would be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. Being fairly stroke addled, I couldn\'t come up with the words to say what I wanted to say so I said ""no."" They thought this was denial and kept trying to convince me I\'d have a good quality of life, and all I could say was ""no"". They finally thought to ask me why, and all I could say was ""stairs"". They tried to tell me someone could carry me up the stairs into my home. I had no words to say I\'d then be trapped because I couldn\'t *leave* without help (there\'s stairs at all doors to my house), or that my house is 100 years old so all the doors are too narrow for a wheelchair so if they brought me in I\'d never be able to leave the kitchen, so I just said ""okay"" and let them go away thinking they\'d convinced me. (Hint: they hadn\'t.) \n* They eventually decided I would probably live a few months before I die, and sent me to rehab.\n* My father then went home, deciding he had seen me and there was nothing more he could do. I was, frankly, glad that I no longer had to try to look good for him. I had no idea that they had told everyone I would probably die.\n* At rehab, they tried to teach me to use a wheelchair. I was having none of that and let them push me around until I could use a walker. They thought this was as good as it would get for me, but I demanded a cane, so they gave me a quad cane (one that ends with a rectangle with four feet). They thought this was as good as it would get for me, but I found the quad tip to get in the way, so I demanded a regular cane. They were sort of astonished that I actually did better with that.\n* Rehab eventually decided that there was nothing more they could do for me and sent me home to die. Still nobody had told me that they expected me to die. (This was probably a good thing because I didn\'t think I should give up.) \n* I had to have nurses 3 times a week in my home and see doctors (including a neurologist and a cardiologist) 3-5 times a month. After 5 or so months the cardiologist admitted to me that I might live for 20 days... or 20 years, and they didn\'t know which yet but it wasn\'t looking good.\n* I refused an implanted defibrillator because the information they presented to me wasn\'t convincing and the idea of more surgery was too scary for me to cope with. I insisted we try medication first. It worked, well enough to surprise all the doctors. I still have to take medication twice daily but with it my heart tests within the bounds of what you could call ""normal"", and the cardiologist tells me that my long term prognosis is good.\n* That was 4.5 years ago. I live independently. I can drive and live my own life, until the #TrumpPlague came along. (My doctors have ordered me to stay home all the time and not to enter any supermarkets or restaurants until I get a vaccine.) I still walk with a cane, but I\'m not very dependent on it in the middle of the day when I\'m very awake. (I still use it, but if I have to have both hands to carry stuff I can take little mincing steps without it.) I have a lot of fatigue, sleep a lot, can\'t really work, have nerve damage in one hand, and I know within my own head that my brain isn\'t what it was (even if my friends can no longer see it), but I\'m doing pretty well given that I was supposed to die.\n\nThe moral of this story is that sometimes people beat all the odds.\n\nRecommendation: Go see her. Be aware that she\'s going to look like hell, but you\'ll know that you did the right thing by going to see her. Say what you need to say in the knowledge that she\'s probably not aware enough to process it but it\'s good for you to say it anyway. Don\'t give up hope yet, give her a few weeks. In a couple weeks if she isn\'t showing significant signs of recovery, if the doctors are saying it\'s a lost cause, they may be right.', ""I can relate to what you're going through.

Has anyone else gone through this? He couldn't move his left arm or leg this morning, but he could talk a little. I can't go to the hospital because of the Coronavirus, and I'm a wreck.

Update :

He had to have emergency surgery. Surgery went well, they got the blood out of his brain and discovered he had an artery bleeding, which caused everything. They got the artery to stop bleeding and got the pressure down enough so that they didn't have to leave any of his skull off. They are keeping the breathing tube in until at least tomorrow and might have to keep him sidated until then. They will be waking him up to make sure he's okay because he was put under. I can call at 6 to get an update. I talked to the actual surgeon who did it and he said he was very happy with the surgery but we aren't out of the woods yet. Thank you all for the prayers, please continue to pray.

Update 2

He's still sedated, but they are doing neurological checks every hour and there has been a small amount of movement in his left leg. They have him on an antibiotic and saline solution that can help his brain. I'm calling back at 9 for another update.

Update 3

Just talked to his nurse. He's made some improvements. He's following commands on the right side of his body perfectly (which shows he's listening) and on the left as much as he can. His left leg seems stronger than his arm right now(he can only extend it a little) . He still hasn't opened his eyes, but one of them is swollen from the surgery and she said he might still be a bit groggy from the sedation. They have him on the lowest setting for the breathing tube and it looks like he's able to breath on his own, but they don't want to take it out until he's been following commands a little longer. They held the phone up to his ear so I could talk to him again, as I was telling him how proud I am of him and that I love him and need him to listen to the doctors and work on following commands and getting things moving he moved his left arm a little!

Hi everyone, I hope you are all keeping well and safe! My name is Joe Hall and I am the lead researcher in a project looking into 'Life after Stroke', being conducted by Glasgow Caledonian University.

We are currently looking to recruit participants to explore **how people manage life after stroke**. We are very interested in **hearing your story and the lessons you have learned following stroke**. We believe that your experiences and the expert knowledge you have gained can help us to beneficially impact the lives of people affected by stroke across the country.

Being a part of this project will involve taking part in a **Participant Interview**. The interview will last between **60-90 minutes**. We would like to record these interviews, but all information taken during the course of the study will be strictly confidential. Naturally, considering the current situation with the Coronavirus, all interviews will take place over the phone or through an online video call (through a platform like Skype).

We are looking to talk to people that **live in the UK**, **are over 18 years old** and **have been adjusting to life after stroke for 12 months or more.**

If you would like more information or have any questions about the project, please feel free to contact me. You can do this either through the following contact details:

It took ALL of her strength the first 5-7 days to be even able to breathe on her own. She could not talk. She could barely move, it was really hard because the first 3 days/ critical 48 hours were nerve wrecking... to say the least. Doctors were worried, I was scared each night she would not make it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom when it happened: she could understand EVERYTHING we said to her, though she could not talk. She is the 'unlucky' 1/3 who have aphasia.\n\n2 weeks in: she'd used to say (and TRY to) yes and no more often. She got speech therapy and could sing!! That's a piece of cake for her. She could count to 5 and back. She made her first sentence out of the blue, wanting to go outside. By the 2,5 week mark, she was ''fired'' from the hospital.\n\n3 weeks in: Rehab now in a nursing home, she's comfy at least, close to home so yay! She'd sit up in her bed when asked, took her a lot of strenght but she still did it on her own :D We used to sing with her every day.4 weeks in: she's luckily not paralyzed, though her left side is weakened. She'd talk more (yes, no and even some other random words.). We sing with her, talk with her, awesome babysteps.\n\n5 weeks to now: all therapy goes extremely well, she can walk a bit on her own, bathroom goes well, she can eat a lot better on her own; she talks more, she could READ around 5 weeks, I was ecstatic :D she does SO so well and I am so proud of her. We're both optimistic. Around the 5th week she could also write her name/ or other words when asked! I was mindblown, it goes great!\n\nI made some communication cards and posters for her and those work SO well. She can point to things she wants (she does that SO well), I made an ''emotion poster'' 3 weeks ago (with emotion icons on it such as ''sad'' 'happy' etc), when asked what she felt when she went to the hospital she was ''lost'' and ''concerned'' BUT she also pointed on the poster she was optimistic. She still is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe still has a LONG road to go, we're working so hard to get her back to at least living a comfortable life. I'm still uncertain of the future but so grateful she's still here, didn't give up. And I look back at where she is now, NO ONE could have imagined this turnaround. But you can say anything to her and she'll understand. It is VERY hard for them to form sentences and even words on their own, but it will take time. :-) I'll be by her side to support and help her whenever and wherever I can.\n\nIn the beginning they will sleep A LOT and need that!! Don't be with too many people present at the same time, this takes a HUGE toll on the body. We were with my grandma 2 at a time, blinking her eyes or even staying breathing is like a marathon for them. It WILL get better and they will have good days (awoke) and less good days where they'll be more tired than other days, but he needs lots of rest too. Sleep makes it better, trust me. Don't worry, give him the rest he needs and don't give too much impulses the first weeks (best is to ask doctors!). Also, try start therapy with your dad ASAP, now is the time and they will learn FAST the forst 6 months in. So its important to stimulate that now :-) They are professionals so they know when to stop (usually therapy sessions will last between 15 mins - 30 mins max in the beginning) but that's something you should pay attention to. Also, I assume you know your dad so be his voice when he can't :D \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here we are now, she's trying to talk back at you, or trying to repeat your sentences. She really WANTS to talk and does her darn best, she's learning new things EACH day. Literally. I wish you the best of luck, sorry English is not my language, but for everyone a stroke and how they come out of it is different; no case is the same. I was so scared on the beginning, scared I would never hear her voice or be able to talk to her. But she's still here! And so is your dad. it takes A LOT of work and patience, but be there for him, teach and support him. That's what matters, tell him how proud you are of him when he learns new things, those are a HUGE accomplishment. Revival after a stroke is significant in the first 6 months, after a year it is what it is, BUT they still learn new things after a year, it is constant development (only slower from then on).\n\nYou can always PM me if you have questions, what's also important in my experience is to treat them like you always treated them, they are STILL there, and it's hard for them to grasp this situation and accept it. Some people can get depressed and I understand, it's really hard for them and family around them, but be strong for him and take care of yourself too!

Still can‚Äôt move one of their arms or one of their legs after a few years, so it just depends. Pray and let your dad rest a lot.\n\nOne of the exercises they‚Äôll probably give him is to blow into a tube and his breath pressure holds a ball up. They may ask you to help him practice when you visit. This can help I think. It‚Äôs bringing back breath control.\n\nFind a good rehab place for when the hospital is ready to release him. Not everywhere has open beds and not everywhere is good. Call around and visit them and inspect the rehab facility. Note, the hospital will try to release him very quick, so be prepared.', ""to be honest I don't quite remember 1st hand everything that exactly happened my first few days/hours afterwards, but according to my brother I had a pretty miraculous recovery.

I lost control of my left arm and, when I yelled ""Mom"" (for kids) I couldn't say Mom- it was like Muulllmmm. 

  
Just got back from an 'echo' and 'bubble' test, and apparently I have a hole between two ventricles, which is congenital, and may have contributed (or been responsible) for the stroke.

I talked to a coworker because I saw I'd spoken with him prior to, and he said I sounded normal... except I don't remember 80% of what we said.

476,My Daughter had a Stroke: Lesson #3 Fulfill the Need.,12,bvdcbm,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/bvdcbm/my_daughter_had_a_stroke_lesson_3_fulfill_the_need/,2," 

The pillows were too hard or too small. The food was too cold, or the drink was too warm. The room was too dark, and the sun was too bright. The first days after our daughter Kari‚Äôs stroke felt like we lived in a horror version of Goldilocks *and The Three Bears*. Comfort in a hospital bed, for a patient with limited mobility remained just beyond reach.

As we sat with Kari ‚Äì especially immediately following her stroke ‚Äì we wanted to make everything right. I craved to fulfill my motherly responsibilities only to fall into depression when I could not.

Instead, I remembered what a friend drilled into my head when I worked to manage situations beyond my control. He would hold up his hands, construct a large circle and say, ‚ÄúCircle of concern.‚Äù Then adjust his hands to sign a small circle, ‚ÄúCircle of influence.‚Äù                        

He coached me to recognize the difference between the two, a lesson I never mastered but continually practiced. A simple quote summarized the concept.

>‚ÄúFocus on what you can control, and don‚Äôt waste energy on the things that you cannot.""                                           -Unknown

##### This message pushed me out of a sulking depression and set me in motion to make a difference. So, the process began to meet Kari‚Äôs basic needs.

Psychology teaches that humans require their most basic needs be fulfilled before they feel safe, grow and mature.  Abraham Maslow formulated this theory‚Äô thus, it is named [Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html).  Any teacher knows that before a child can learn, they must have food, water, sleep, and shelter.

https://i.redd.it/42gykxv1am131.gif

(Since it is not my lesson to teach - and would take this story in an unintended direction, I reference *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey. A brief explanation is found in [Stephen Covey's Circle of Concern and Circle of Influence.](https://dplearningzone.the-dp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/Covey.pdf)))

I looked at Kari: her body wrapped in a rough, cotton, generic hospital blanket, nourishment through an IV, family gathered at her side. Her most basic needs were met - but at a minimum.

##### Distraught and knowing her medical needs rested in the hands of the staff, I created a VISION of an environment to promote healing.

##### I became Mom on a MISSION: Fulfill Kari‚Äôs needs.

### Physiological

##### Food and Water

Armed with a Styrofoam cup of ice chips, I spooned minute pieces into Kari‚Äôs mouth and shared even smaller drops of water.  Nurses warned of the dangers of fluid carrying bacteria into her lungs that might cause pneumonia. Immediate relief appeared on her face and her eyes reflected less stress when lemon cotton swaps brushed her lips; as time went on lip balm provided relieve. Because Burt‚Äôs Bees Balm was a familiar part of her regular, daily routine, a small hill of tubes piled on the bedside table, donated by friends who knew her obsession. Her smile showed acknowledgment of a small success.

##### Restful Slumber

Sleep came and went as a bodily function, but comfort seemed out of reach until we learned how to pull her up in bed. Because the doctors required the bed elevated at 30%, she constantly slipped into a crumpled, distorted lump without the ability to shift and find comfort. With a person on either side of her bed, and a folded sheet placed under her posterior, we discovered she could easily be adjusted by lifting and pulling the sheet. Dan, her husband, brought her favorite ultra-soft, plush fleece blanket from home. Once positioned and cocooned, we added an oversized, malleable body pillow in a silk case that absorbed her and induced slumber. Kari rested when comfortable, if only for brief moments.

Safety

##### Health

Following doctor‚Äôs orders, we lived in the shadow the first days. So rest could strengthen her body and mind, we waited with the curtains closed and the lights dimmed. As we sat beside Kari we spoke in whispers. To minimize distractions, we limited noises to muffled reassuring voices. As one day bled into another, I noticed her irritation at the whispers. She interpreted the silent conversations as hidden information we kept secret from her. After that we talked in normal volumes providing assurances that her situation improved daily, and we hid nothing.

##### Employment: Purpose

When I observed the hospital staff often asked the family questions, I realized we removed her ability to make decisions and control her own destiny.  When she was well, Kari would never have accepted surrendering to the will of others, so I began directing questions to her. At first, she could only respond with simple gestures or eye movements, but she controlled her life. This behavior conveyed the message that healing required her to be an active participant in the process. Prior to this understanding, we too often talked **about** her and not **to** her. Once we acknowledged Kari‚Äôs inclusion/control needs, we created situations where she became an actress in her own story.

##### Resources

In the beginning, resources to provide security were elusive. In fact, we all felt afraid and off balanced because of the unknowns. However, propelled by the mission and vision, to fulfill Kari‚Äôs needs by creating a healing environment, strategies formed. I admit these were never consciously defined but through reflection, the goals developed, and a plan evolved.

The few resources available provided normalcy. Aware she probably heard words without comprehending the plot, I read aloud providing information and stimulus. When we reintroduced music, one of her passions, the physical tension diminished when the voices of Garth and Randy Travis resonated in the background. Comforts from home.

I specifically remember the night Jodi, Kari‚Äôs daughter reminded us her mom slept with a fan app that dispersed white noise during the night. How could I forget after the night I shared a bed in their camper and the noise kept me awake all night. But yes, for Kari it provided comfort, and Jodi‚Äôs inspiration proved valuable as it blocked out the nighttime interruptions in the hall. Small interventions fashioned refuge for our daughter‚Äôs fragile body.

##### Property

The surroundings looked like . . .well . . .  a hospital room. Not an environment that yelled, ‚ÄúGood morning. It‚Äôs time to get better.‚Äù If this was to become Kari‚Äôs home away from home, personal touches needed to be added. We strung colorful yarn above her bed, attaching to the side wall and to these, attached pictures of family and friends who smiled down at her day and night. These pictures proved valuable in therapy when used to prompt her to recognize faces and remember names. On the shelves sat framed pictures, a softball signed by all the players of her daughter‚Äôs softball team, crystals with healing powers, and a multitude of items shared by beloved friends. The bulletin board held 23 get well cards from her kindergarten students and colored pictures from her daughters.  Items assembled to bombard her senses and stimulate memories that were out of reach due to the brain trauma.

### Love 

##### Family and Friend

After the stroke, Kari accomplished little by herself. For an independent woman this produced increased frustration. I remember once prior to her stroke, Dan told me Kari had a backache. When I asked how she hurt her back, his response made me laugh. He explained she carries everybody and everything on her back. A true statement! She failed at sharing the workload, and I remembered her saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to just do it myself.‚Äù

##### However, she readily accepted our love.

Tasks once thought of as daily routines required new efforts; to her displeasure, they required help. We filled the toothbrush with paste, wiped sleep from her eyes, brushed her hair and at times held the spoon that provided nourishment. We learned never to say Kari can‚Äôt do something and instead we said, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù As quickly as possible, she took back each responsibility. Sometimes probably too early which at times had us holding our breath and praying God guide her but providing her the confidence to accomplish more each day.

Amazed, I watched loved ones perform acts of love. Never underestimate the power of lotion. When confined to a bed, shoulders tighten, muscles stiffen, feet crack, hands dry-up, and a mind weighs down with burdens. We discovered Dan‚Äôs magic massage hands instilled tranquility.

When Face-timing with her best friend in another state, words flowed less obstructed, it was a natural, joyous conversation. When her niece ran into the room and yelled, ‚ÄúKiki‚Äù (her name for Aunt Kari), their warm embrace raised the temperature in the room.

&#x200B;

When Kari and her sister, Kat, cleared the room and ate dinner together, laughter overflowed to the hallway. To have been a fly on that wall! There would be even more stories to tell.

##### And all the sadness disappeared when Jodi or Eliza climbed in the bed with their mom to cuddle. All became right with the world.

The clich√© resonated, ‚ÄúIt takes a village to raise a child.‚Äù It rang true in the hospital. Our village offered security simply by sharing love.

As this is a story about meeting needs, it must end here. Kari‚Äôs climb to the last two stages of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy continues in stories yet to be told.

All you have to do is put antifungal cream on it once or twice and it\'ll go away for months, so with a great effort I managed to put the words together to ask for the cream. They told me my medical proxy would have to approve it, and that didn\'t surprise me, because it\'s technically a medication after all. My hands were very dry, the skin was flaking off, and I asked for some moisturizer for those. I was also told my medical proxy would have to approve it. They\'d better be glad I wasn\'t able to put two words together to swear at them about that.\n\nThere was no restriction about volume around me, but they had a lot of quiet discussions outside my room, and I knew it and this offended me a lot. However, I wasn\'t able to speak well enough to say anything about that, and nobody cared what I thought. \n\nI was thirsty *all the time*, and they wouldn\'t give me ice chips or a drop of water or do anything to relieve it. I wasn\'t able to communicate how much of a problem this was for me. They went directly from ""nope, no water"" to giving me a huge container of water (imagine a mug that holds a gallon) and telling me I had to drink that much every day. \n\nI couldn\'t sleep. I was super uncomfortable all the time - they put a paper pad under my bottom, and it kept getting soaked with sweat and sticking to me and making me really, really uncomfortable. Also they insisted that I had to sleep on my back. I\'m a side sleeper, and have been for 40 years, so I can\'t sleep on my back. Also, at night when I was supposedly allowed to sleep, they\'d wake me up for tests every few hours. So effectively I got no sleep at all, I would just pass out from exhaustion from time to time, and I had horrible hallucinations when I did so this was traumatic for me. (People kept treating it like it was a given that I\'d pass out from time to time because I\'m a stroke victim, the reality was that I was just exhausted. I probably would have slept a lot if I wasn\'t kept exhausted by circumstances, but not passed out all the time.) After a few days I was able to speak enough to communicate the problem to them, so they gave me sleeping pills, which didn\'t exactly relieve the problem, I\'d sleep through some minor tests (like blood pressure) but I\'d just be more groggy and miserable for the rest. (I do think the sleeping pills managed to help me not have hallucinations at night however.)\n\nWhen I was in ICU they had pictures my niece and nephew drew from me and letters from the family pinned to the bulletin board in my room... on the other side of the room where I couldn\'t see it without my glasses. (And even with them, it was too far away to read anything.) Every now and then somebody would give me my glasses, but then a helpful nurse would come along and see me looking sleepy and say ""here, let me put those on the night stand for you,"" take them off of me (I\'d be trying to say ""no"" but struggling for words), and put them on the night stand... where I couldn\'t reach them. So I\'d be blind again for another day or two, since I was unable to ask for them. When I got to the rehab hospital, they had nicely boxed everything for me (all the drawings etc), but nobody ever unboxed it for me, and I spent 2 months in a beige room with nothing personal in it. Eventually some friends brought be a blanket and I was so grateful, because it was *blue* and the only spot of color I\'d had in months. \n\nI\'m told friends played music for me while I was unconscious. I\'m told the only thing I reacted to was the soundtrack to Hamilton. I had never heard it, and didn\'t remember it, so months later I got Alexa to play it for me. I *hate* the soundtrack to Hamilton, I hope I never hear it again. When I woke up there was no music, only the TV, so it was actual months before I got home and could listen to my music again. \n\nI tried desperately to do for myself, but I realized quickly that the hospital staff was used to people saying ""I can\'t"" all the time and not bothering to try, so when I said ""I can\'t"" because I meant it they didn\'t take me seriously. So for example one day they told me I\'d have to serve myself food now, no more spoon feeding me, and I said ""I can\'t"" and they more or less told me to deal with it, they didn\'t consider that maybe I was accurately assessing my own ability, so I got food all over everything and was kinda starving for a few days. \n\nNobody video chatted me. I couldn\'t hold the phone, and nobody did it for me. I had a telephone, but they kept putting that where I couldn\'t reach it, and they gave out the wrong number to all my friends and family so nobody could reach me, I had to call them and I couldn\'t remember any phone numbers. \n\nWhen I was in ICU all my friends dropped in to see me and say hi. When I got to the rehab hospital, it was out of town, and hard to get to, so I rarely had any visitors. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is very lucky to have you there.']",477

**Life can literally change on a dime. Mine did this last Thursday morning.**

**I woke up from a hazy morning sleep about 5:30am to see my husband sitting outside on a bench looking at our swimming pool. Our 14 year old dog was with him, keeping watch and looking for feral cats who like to frequent our back yard.**

**I dozed off for another ten minutes, and when I woke up, he was no longer on the bench in the backyard. He hadn't been feeling well, so I got up and found him sitting on the edge of our guestroom bed. When I called to him, I couldn't understand what he was saying.**

**‚ÄúWhat are you doing in here?‚Äù I asked him. I walked towards him and realize one side of his face had drooped, his speech was slurred and he tried to tell me he didn't feel good. He managed to stand up and walk into our bedroom and lay down on the bed. I realized immediately he was having stroke. I got him a baby aspirin, which fortunately he took immediately.**

**After arguing back and forth about his condition for a minute, I stood my ground and called 9-1-1! Fortunately they arrived in less than 5 minutes. Two ambulance attendants and two fire department paramedics arrived, and transported him to the nearest hospital with a neuro unit.**

**While he was being assessed for a possible stroke in the emergency room, he had a heart attack. If you're going to have a heart attack, having it in the emergency room while you're being triaged is probably the best place to have it.**

**He has now been in the hospital for a week. During that time, they determined the stroke was small, cleared the blockage in his artery in his heart that caused both issues, and placed a stent in his artery. The doctors were optimistic that he should recover fairly quickly.**

**Within about two hours, he was placed in the ICU and seemed to be stable. Then things changed.**

**When he couldn't pass the swallow test for three days in a row (yes they really do assess if you can swallow correctly), they determined his vocal cords and the muscles in his throat are paralyzed on one side. The water he has been allowed, which isn't much, has now caused him to have pneumonia. Add to all this, he has a lung infection, a urinary infection, and his oxygen dropped to a critical level.**

**We've got him stable for now but we argue every day about why he can't have water, and why he can't come home with me.**

**Having a once vibrant, intelligent, physical man turn into a very sick patient in just a few days is terrifying, exhausting and mentally challenging. If you've ever had to deal with someone you love who suddenly becomes very sick, you understand what a challenge this scenario is.**

**We're only on day 7 but it feels like a lifetime. Unfortunately, this is not my first time as a caregiver.** 

**My son at the age of 13 was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in his left femur, also known as bone cancer. His treatment lasted a year being the hospital 3 weeks out of every five, along with having a titanium prosthetic femur placed in his leg. We were lucky and he's now been in remission for 25 years, gotten married and given me two beautiful and adorable grandchildren through the miracles of modern medicine.**

**I'm not trying to sell you anything but to express that if you too are going through this trying experience, you are not alone. Don't hesitate to reach out to me.**",2019-05-02 02:08:31+00:00,"['>**If you\'re going to have a heart attack, having it in the emergency room while you\'re being triaged is probably the best place to have it.** \n\nI speak from experience when I tell you that no, it isn\'t: the table in ICU in the best hospital in the world while surrounded by doctors and nurses as they\'re about to install life support (and thus already have the machine there and prepped and ready) is the best place and time to have a heart attack if you\'re going to have one. I will never be able to express the depth of my gratitude to the fine staff at Tufts Medical Center who literally invented a new method on the spot to save me.\n\n>**We were lucky and he\'s now been in remission for 25 years, gotten married and given me two beautiful and adorable grandchildren through the miracles of modern medicine.** \n\nLook... *I am* a miracle of modern medicine. I am alive because I just happened to walk into the hospital an hour before I had 6 strokes and a heart attack. (They\'re still incredulous about the fact that I *walked* in the door on my own two feet, took the elevator up to the office and sat calmly in the waiting room until they were ready for me to talk to them.) If I hadn\'t happened to go in, or it hadn\'t happened to be that particular hospital, I\'d be dead instead of writing to you. \n\nSpeaking as a miracle of modern medicine, I can say that at only one week from the stroke, there\'s just no way to tell what the ultimate outcome will be. A lot of it will depend on how severe and where the damage is, and a lot of it will depend on how hard he\'s willing to work on doing his exercises and making a recovery. It\'s not going to be easy for him. It\'s going to be the hardest thing he ever did. Elizabeth Taylor, who suffered for most of her life from terrible debilitating back pain, said, \n\n>*You just do it. You force yourself to get up. You force yourself to put one foot before the other, and God damn it, you refuse to let it get to you. You fight. You cry. You curse. Then you go about the business of living. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it. There‚Äôs no other way.*\n\n3.5 years out from my stroke, I still feel that way. People can\'t see - because I\'ve become very good at covering it up - how much I struggle to act normal and live an apparently ordinary daily life. How hard it is for me to just go to the supermarket, or to go out to lunch with friends, or sometimes even to open my mouth and say ""hi"". And while I am honest with my doctors about this, and while a few close people have seen me crashing at the end of a day of doing stuff, I do my best to hide it from most people most of the time.  \n\nSo it\'s going to be hard as heck for your husband. It\'s going to be very hard for him 3 years from now, but (and I\'m serious about this, I\'m telling you because I think you need to know, I\'m not trying to be condescending) you can\'t possibly imagine how hard it\'s going to be for him in the next few months. He is now exhausted like you\'ve never imagined, and if he is talking to you that means he has prioritized spending his very limited strength on talking to you. (It also means that his brain is able to talk. Believe me, I wasn\'t for rather a while, and I still have difficulty sometimes.) \n\nYou know (and I know that you know, so I\'m preaching to the choir here, but it still has to be said) that as a caregiver you need to look after yourself. So look after yourself. Remember that he\'s in good hands, that at least for now you don\'t have to deal with his day to day care, and focus your time on being supportive to him and seeing to it that they are pointing their caregiving efforts at whatever is best for him. (I was in the hospital for 2.5 months. During this time mostly they made great decisions, but occasionally someone would have to tell them ""you\'re doing it wrong, he needs *this*. Initially I had friends and family around all the time to see and tell them, but eventually I was on my own, and struggled to exert myself on those rare occasions when it was necessary.)', 'I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this. Wish you all the best. Life sucks.', 'It‚Äôs worse for him. Don‚Äôt forget that', 'Thanks for posting. My best wishes to both you & your husband. He‚Äôs lucky to have you by his side. Oft repeated and trite sounding advice, but take care of yourself.', ""I'm sorry you and your husband are going through this.\n\n>**yes they really do assess if you can swallow correctly**\n\nI was so frustrated in the time up until the therapist came to do the post-stroke swallowing assessment, I was asking for water from everyone. Even on a hydrating IV, your mouth tells you it's thirsty. I joked with my sister that I would settle for drinking from the saline drip. That first sip of water during my assessment was the best thing ever. I can't imagine how hard it must be for your husband to go a week not allowed water by mouth. When my mother was on a feeding tube and trach, unable to swallow after throat cancer, she had medicated swabs for dry mouth. I don't recall what was on the swabs, though. It's worth asking whether something like that might help alleviate that part of his distress.""]",478

Four months ago my dad (59) had a massive left-sided ischemic stroke while overseas. Thankfully they were close to a hospital and got him in and did a thrombectomy/started tPA quickly. He struggled a lot at first with right-sided weakness and aphasia which is to be expected. 

In the first few weeks/month of his recovery he had drastic improvement in using his right side and was motivated in speech therapy. He was positive most of the time and focused on recovery. He is a doctor and still has all his medical knowledge which has been good and bad at times.

Since about mid-November he's started to get more and more negative about things, telling family members ""I'm done"" and acting like he wasn't interested in being alive anymore. It all came to a head this past weekend when my brother was home visiting from Germany. My dad told my brother that he won't be here the next time my brother comes back. We've tried to discuss it with his neurologist, who was a colleague of my dad's, and he told us that this is in line with how my dad had expressed that he would feel in a situation like this before he had the stroke and the neurologist wasn't concerned. 

TLDR: dad had stroke and is having suicidal thoughts. Refuses medications for mood/any help. Looking for words of wisdom/resources for dealing with suicidal thoughts in stroke patients since neurologist has been no help.

I can drive now, I've started doing some work, and I'm fairly independent.  Last month I found out that I'm likely to be on the anti-seizure meds for the rest of my life, because I have a hole in my cortex.  It was a bit of a blow, but I'm adjusting to it.

I live in a small town in south central Colorado, where it very difficult to meet people and make friends, because people my age are very insular.  I also worry that my stroke has taken over my life, and its become a defining aspect of who I am.  Before anyone says anything, I know that's not true, and I'm seeing a therapist.  I also still go to speech therapy because I have trouble remaining on topic in conversations and with word finding.  But still my biggest problem is loneliness.  I'm also still dealing with a break up that happened before the stroke because I never had time to really process it.

What do y'all do about forgetfulness and the anxiety around it? I struggle pretty bad with it. I'm always losing my phone, forgetting appointments and deadlines.

I put reminders in my phone which helps a lot, bit if I forget to do that then I'm screwed.

I get anxiety that I'm annoying people with it as well. Like I ask a lot for verification on stuff or my fam and I have a group chat and we send memes and stuff a lot. I worry that I'm sending the same stuff over and over cuz I can't remember.

A lacunar infarction is a stroke that happens in the small blood vessels deep in the brain. Sometimes people don't know that they had a lacunar infarct and only find out through imaging at a later date. Others have severe symptoms.

An article updated in 2021 found that [lacunar infarctions make up around 16%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534206/) of all ischemic strokes. They most often occur in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and brainstem.

The most common cause of lacunar infarction is chronic, uncontrolled high blood pressure. So whether you've had lacunar infarction or just want to reduce your stroke risk, staying on appropriate medications and watching sodium intake is extremely important!

510,G is for...,10,n9y2tc,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n9y2tc/g_is_for/,4,"**G is for grief.**

The Stages of Grief model, created by Elizabeth K√ºhbler-Ross in 1969, describes the experience of those who are dying. This same model has been applied to stroke recovery as many survivors feel that they are grieving their pre-stroke self.

1. In the **denial** stage, you may have trouble coming to terms with having had a stroke. You may feel complete bewilderment that this happened to you which is a protective mechanism from shock.
2. In the **anger** stage, you may feel angry at everything and everyone: anger at yourself or others for the situation in which you find yourself. It‚Äôs normal and expected that there is some level of anger in the grieving process. The thing to try and remember during this stage is to not lash out.
3. The **bargaining** stage is primarily about feeling a lack of control over your situation and doing what you can to feel more in control. You may find yourself making promises to a Higher Power if they will only take you back to the time before your stroke.
4. It‚Äôs also normal to go through a **depression** stage where you might feel isolated, lonely, depressed, or in emotional pain. It‚Äôs fine to spend some time feeling this pain in order to move away from it.
5. **Acceptance** sits on a spectrum. It can range from accepting that a stroke has happened to recognizing current limitations and working within them. It can mean accepting your post-stroke self but also being motivated to continue your recovery efforts in the hope of making more progress.

If you'd like to know more, you can read my article, [Grief and Acceptance](https://elysenewland.com/articles/grief-and-acceptance).

511,"Dad (63) had a hemorrhagic stroke, living abroad and getting conflicting information from family",12,n2hbr2,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n2hbr2/dad_63_had_a_hemorrhagic_stroke_living_abroad_and/,5,"Hi everyone,

I guess I'm here to vent and get some advice and perspective.

My dad suffered a hemorrhagic stroke a week ago. I live in the UK, and my family is in another country, a 4-hour flight away. He was in the ICU for 2 days, was discharged from the ICU, then as a result of pneumonia and increasing blood pressure had to be returned to the ICU again. He is unconscious - kept in medically induced sleep to avoid stress. I'm being told different stories by the family there (my mother, aunt, stepbrother and his mother). What I know for sure is that there's blood in his brain, surgery is not currently possible as he's  too weak, but his condition is not deteriorating and blood pressure has been reduced. What I don't know is just how grave the situation is - my mother says he's unlikely to survive (as told by one doctor), my brother is keen on keeping up the fight, as another doctor is much less pessimistic in his prognosis.

I genuinely don't know what to do - so far, my main contribution has been sending as much money as I can and staying sane. Should I go there to be with my family? The caveat is that I'd have to quarantine there and when I come back, and I also need to find somewhere to stay (for various reasons). There's no public transport, and I'm worried about being a burden at what already is a tough time. I also can't see my dad because of Covid, so I'd just be hanging around...

Also, how grave does this sound? His CT scan shows no sign of deterioration, but I'm concerned by the fact that they are unable to proceed with the surgery.

Apologies for the wall of text and the rambling thoughts, my mind is racing.

UPDATE: My dad passed away yesterday. I'm now trying to get a PCR test and make arrangements to fly home. Stroke is horrible. My thoughts are with everyone else going through this awful ordeal.",2021-05-01 12:23:49+00:00,"[""It's possible your family could be giving you conflicting information because they're getting conflicting information from the hospital, and the information can change on a daily basis as his condition fluctuates especially with being in and out of ICU. Agree with above you should be able to get a hold of members of his team over the phone, mind you the team doesn't have time to be having the same conversations over and over again with multiple members of the family so always best if you can have your mom or brother conference call you in while they're speaking with the doctors. Medicine is unpredictable and it's good to plan for all outcomes while hoping for the best.\nI think reasons for rushing there would be (I hate to say this and I'm in no way suggesting this is the most likely outcome) if it becomes a saying goodbye situation, you would be close, and possibly through quarantine. Hospital policies very widely right now due to preventing covid spread, at times family is allowed in for end of life visits, and at times they're not, might be worth looking up on their website or asking. Some people like to remember their family members as they 'were', rather than making painful new memories in ICUs with people that only vaguely resemble their former selves. This is a really personal choice that you'd have to ask yourself. Another reason might be, If you feel your family's not coping well and you would be able to help them, cooking, cleaning, driving, etc, Though I see how the logistics are challenging here. And having no idea what the country/climate/living situation is, this might be a wildly inappropriate suggestion, but I know there are people who have been 'camping' in backyards or in trailers. You could ask to speak with the social services department at the hospital to see if they have any partnerships with nearby short-term rentals, or if there are foundations that offer housing support a la Ronald McDonald House. \nSome reasons for waiting: you would be much more helpful to your family and your dad once he's hopefully discharged out of hospital, to home, rehab etc. There will be a lot more to do, and you may be able to see him. If money is a sizeable issue, then being home and working for longer makes sense. And it's possible he could need a lot of equipment when he comes out of hospital, for mobility and self-care etc. Medications follow up appointments. \nIt's a really impossible to predict the course of these things, and definitely hard to know what the right decision is. Things can turn quickly, for better or worse. Hemorrhagic strokes typically have longer and more complicated hospital stays than clot-based strokes, but the rehab can go much quicker once swelling goes down. Every stroke is so different and every person is so different that it's hard for you to get information about your dad other than directly through the medical professionals that know his whole situation. Ie you will be limited in the information you're able to glean from reading about them on the internet. I really feel for you and acknowledge how Covid makes everything much worse. Hoping he pulls through and that you are able to continue staying sane, and looking after yourself (because that's really important, can't stress that enough)."", 'I think you could definetly try to make one of the involved doctors call you when they have time to about confusion, but also to just try to stay calm as Strokes especially can have very different diagnostics and treatments within small timeframes.\nI am in no means experienced but i Think the best way to have concrete Information is via the hospital itself, ich wish your father all the best from the bottom of my heart', ""My wife just got out of the hospital for the same, albeit younger than your dad. If his bleed is stable and he doesn't have any other complications hopefully he can be discharged soon and managed outpatient. My wife's family did not fly in because we weren't facing emergency surgery and the hospital restricted visitors from Covid, but once home, her sister came to stay with us. Perhaps you can do the same. In the meantime, call his nurse directly for updates if family may be unreliable or overwhelmed. Good luck to you and your father!!"", ""I have found information is often conflicting from different doctors as the condition changes as well as from different family members as it is affected by their understanding of what they are told and their own levels of hope. My mother had cancer many years ago and both my brother and father were convinced she was going to die despite the fact we were NEVER at any point told she would or what her chances were. The answer from the doctors was always 'we don't know'. My brother thought she would die because he read about poor outcomes in a research paper and my father thought she would die because he is a pessimistic person. I chose to believe she would live because I simply could not get through it any other way. Their interpretations of doctors information was always different to mine. She is 8 years cancer free. \n\nMy point is the information you are getting is also be coloured by others emotions."", ""I was in a similar situation about 8 years ago (as the patient).

Instead, they'll describe the current situation, and what they plan to do next.

I had my stroke about five months ago, 1 December 2020. My left hand felt like I had lost 3 months of gains in fine motor- in the following 2days as I was freaking out and while my hand ebbed and flowed. Overall I feel like I‚Äôve lost a little bit of progress my hand isn‚Äôt quite where it was before Monday, it seems hour to hour to change between 70-90% back to baseline. One thing I realized is that when I was freaking out about it it was barely working at all but when I calm down or wake up in the middle of the night it seems completely back to baseline. I guess in the five months since my stroke I just gotten used to it not working as well and have let off of therapy a bit so I have forgotten where baseline is. I  started playing video games again recently and have been using that as therapy and notice I‚Äôm having a harder time playing. I don‚Äôt have any other returning deficit such as speech, strength ( have a hand meter), drift or any thing just fine motor . Oddly enough my right hand seems to be trying to move when I try to move my left hand again which happened to me in my first few months of recovery. I am sad to see my neurologist again in month and a half and will do an MRI then though I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs very likely nothing to worry about.  I also find it hard to not obsess about every clumsy movement which isn‚Äôt helping. I feel like part of me is comparing my current to my pre-stroke not my baseline.  I am just wondering how everyone else deals with setbacks. This is my first real setback that has lasted more than a couple hours so I‚Äôm a little freaked out about it and want to not obsess. I know everyone can have bad days or weeks I‚Äôm just wondering how you deal with that. Thanks",2021-04-22 20:38:04+00:00,"['My wife(36 y/o) had a brainstem stroke 5 years ago. Initial prognosis was lifelong ventilator, feeding tube, and never walking again.  She came off the vent about a month after the stroke, had her G-tube removed around 6 weeks, and took her first steps in that same time frame. \n\nNow 5 years later, those successes feel far away (to her). She still struggles with right-side hemiplegia, fatigue, brain-fog, and pain, but she is alive, and very much involved in our day-to-day life.\n\nNow I want to answer your question in terms of *my* perception of how *she* sees her physical/mental state. She feels setbacks nearly every day. Sometimes, she can go 3 or 4 days and feel above her baseline in terms of physical ability and mental health. However, she will inevitably have a ‚Äúsetback‚Äù. This can be a setback of her physical or mental state or both. For example, she will feel that her hand is not working as well it sometimes does, or that she has no energy, or she may be crying and depressed - mourning the life she lost.  After 5 years, I‚Äôve learned different ways to help her through these different types of setbacks. \n\nFor physical setbacks, I will recount the previous day(s) activities to either see if anything she did could be a contributing factor to her current state.  Perhaps yesterday she spent a few hours doing her hair and makeup and today her nystagmus is more severe.  If that doesn‚Äôt help explain it, I‚Äôll review medications to see if she missed something. Next (if appropriate) I‚Äôll offer to assist with physical therapy or massage. If that doesn‚Äôt help - I just remind her of the progress she‚Äôs made in the last 5 years, tell her I love her and to not beat herself up mentally over something she can‚Äôt control. \n\nFor mental health setbacks, I just do my best to be there for her. Let her cry, let her sleep, give her a hug, or try to redirect her thoughts to more positive things. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. \n\nFinally, for a concrete answer to your question, I highly recommend making a daily (or twice daily) log of your physical and mental state, noting any significant activities or accomplishments. This can be useful as a reference and to identify any patterns in setbacks that may point to certain activities, times-of-day, times-of-month, when they may be more prevalent. \n\nOne last thing I want to add - I‚Äôve had 3 back surgeries including a fusion. Some days, my back pain is barely noticeable and I feel great. Other days, I‚Äôm aching and have to take it easy. I don‚Äôt look at those ‚Äúbad‚Äù days as setbacks because I suffered an injury and my back isn‚Äôt going ever be what it was prior to the injury.  I look at my wife‚Äôs brain injuries the same way. She has trouble seeing it that way, but it helps me to look at it from that perspective. \n\nHope this helps!', 'For me, I remember my physical therapist told me about the mood-swings and energy level would wax and wane.

So this way I got to study as well as spend time with him during evenings."", 'Stroke has two important parts to focus on for recovery - starting therapy as soon as possible, and avoiding another stroke. The neurologists will likely focus on avoiding another one. This will include medication, monitoring, and assessing her risk level. The hospital might help with the therapy part but often insurance only covers a few sessions and they can be limited. Therapy will likely focus on the limb movement and speech therapy. Unfortunately the vision loss is harder to recover, and therapy for this is only available experimentally, not clinically (my assumption is that the loss is in both eyes, on the left hand side, unless the stroke affected one eye directly). That being said some spontaneous improvement is expected in all of these issues early on, the day of the stroke is usually the worst of it.\n\nMy non-medical advice would be to reach out to support groups in your area to see what resources they have, listen to the doctors, research therapy options, and be supportive.

Whilst at hospital, he contracted Pneumonia as well as Covid, and we were told to 'standby for a goodbye visit'. As it happens, he survived it all, and was discharged into an intermediary care home, and since back to us a few days ago.

He can just about walk, barely talk, cannot swallow anything and is PEG fed, which is turning out to be very difficult. He's incredibly angry about very small and ostensibly insignificant things, and whilst he may have been a difficult man before, he's turning out to be much more of a handful now. He's also incontinent, which no one told us about until the day before his return home. 

As his mother died of multiple strokes, and he cared for her during her death, he told us 'never let that happen to me, don't let me live like that', so we gave the doctor his 'Do not resuscitate' wishes. He learned about this and has since accused everyone of trying to kill him and is being verbally offensive to everyone who's trying to help him.

Some of this is understandable, some of this may be 'post hospital adjustment', but this is shaping up to be an incredibly upsetting and difficult journey, especially as my mother, who's 6 years his senior and not physically capable herself, is being woken up at all times of the night, told to clean things up, call people etc. My father called her 17 times in the night and turned on all the TVs in the house at 4am to get her attention. She's holding off permanent at home care/care home as they're cost-prohibitive, but something's got to give, as this will destroy her.

Very similar story for us- no pneumonia or COVID, but a stroke right before Christmas, and then another one a few days later with so much anger.  He\'s been home for about a month. Also incontinent, has a catheter and has to wear Depends. It\'s devastating, and I so feel for you. It fucking sucks. \n\nOne idea that has absolutely been a *lifesaver* for us: Hire a nursing student instead of home health care. We had home healthcare for about a week and it was expensive and they were TERRIBLE. We then found and hired a senior nursing student who comes for 3 hours a day, 90 minutes morning and night, Monday through Friday. $60 a day. Not cheap, but SO much cheaper than $35 an hour with a 3 hour minimum, and we get the care we need. She has experience in nursing homes, we pay her under the table, it\'s a win-win. My dad, uh, tolerates her. Most days. More than he did home health, who he despised because they were generally really, really bad at their jobs. We found the student through a college kid we know- she\'s his roommate. Your mom may be able to call a local nursing school (if there is one in her area) to ask if they have a jobs board or if they know anyone. \n\nAlso, if she\'s in the US, she may be eligible for Medicaid if she\'s low-income- there are some exceptions that allow people with higher incomes to qualify than you might think. \n\nSecond: Does your dad have a primary care physician? My dad has like eight doctors, all of whom\'s philosophy seems to be ""Well, that\'s not really my problem."" We finally got him in to see his primary care physician from before the stroke, who was able to help us coordinate a bunch of things that everyone else had handed off to someone, anyone, else. \n\nThird: Anti-depressants and a sleeping pill for him. He\'s on Prozac and then 2 Trazodone at night. The Trazodone changed everything for my mom. He was also up all night being a jackass (hitting the wall, throwing stuff to get her up, loudly complaining to the dog that she\'s abandoned him, etc) and now he sleeps from about 7 to 7. She\'s doing so much better because she\'s getting solid sleep now. Another idea, this isn\'t ideal, but....could she put a child lock on his door? If she\'s sleeping near him, it wouldn\'t be a fire danger and it would keep him from wandering or turning on the TVs or other annoying/impulsive. She could make the room safe for him if he throws a fit, and just leave him. \n\nFour: Does she have therapists coming in who can help her figure out workable solutions to issues? We have a speech therapist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and a home health nurse come in for all his various therapies. He gets super irritated if we\'re honest with them about what\'s actually going on (especially the mental health stuff, which has been a big issue) so we\'ve done things like gone out to meet them in the driveway so we can have a quick conversation, or ""help them carry stuff to the car,"" same reason. \n\nFive: Is there something he likes to do? My dad likes old movies. \n\nLast: Anti-depressants for her, and also maybe therapy. This sucks, and she needs support. IF she\'s at all tech-savvy, there are lots of online therapy options. \n\nSo sorry you\'re going through this.  It sucks.', 'Sorry you and your family are going through this.

She has support for the next several weeks from various medical professionals but I'm looking for anything that I can do to help with her recovery, especially emotionally.

521,Post-stroke sleep disruption?,11,ke28qj,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ke28qj/poststroke_sleep_disruption/,9,"Hi all

I'm a 40 year old male from the UK. I suffered a small stroke at the beginning of November (an intraparenchymal bleed in my right basal ganglia to be precise!) and was in hospital for a week. I have no lasting physical issues (I did have problems with weakness in my left arm and leg for a couple of days and the left side id my face drooped but thats fine now). It was caused by what they call runaway Hypertension and I'm now on 4 types of blood pressure medication: amlodipine, atenelol, doxazosin and candesartan. These have got my blood pressure under control - from 154/88 down to 126/64 or as low as 113/68.

I dont have any general side effects (other than I really feel the cold in my hands and feet now) and generally consider myself bloody lucky.

A few weeks after being home I had a follow-up call with the hospital and I discussed a couple of things. One being my disrupted sleep. Coming out of hospital, I slept a lot, day and night. But soon got back to just night sleeping. I've always hated naps as they don't refresh me, they just make me feel like crap. However, I found that if I woke during the night that I was done for, sleepwise. The doctors initial response was to change the time of my doxazosin to evening and not morning. This has been met with limited success.

Right now its 4:15am here and I've been awake since 1:30am. The night before I was up from 4:30 and the.nigjt before it was about 2:30.

I will sometimes start to feel sleepy again between 5 and 6 and then sleep until past 9 of I'm able (my husband gets up for work ar around 7:30 and is as quiet as he can be) i do work from home and it is having an impact on that.

I have raised this again with my GP, who is loathe to give out more medication but has said I can have amitriptyline if I want, but as I'm averaging 4 nights sleep a week (I suppose....?) then this is acceptable and my bodyclock will right itself after a while.

My husband worries about me after I dont sleep, in a way that I consider a bit ""naggy"", but I know that he's doing it out of love.

Has anyone else suffered sleep disruption after the stroke? Did it reset without the use of medication?

My only other 'issue' is that I don't feel my brain is alive. That sounds crazy. I mean, I don't feel any kind of creative or dynamic spark in there any more.  Does that make more sense? Creative links, intuition, that kind of leaping from one point to another, all seems to have gone. Is this an actual thing?

I have a follow up appointment with my local stroke unit in January so will mention it to them as well, but I appreciate community feedback!

Looking back, taking seroquel was extremely sedative and really ruined my productivity the next morning. I would never want to take it again, however, I do think that the trade off of getting good rest is worth trying a couple of drugs to see what might work for you, specifically. Eventually, I forced myself to get off of any sleep medicine. It was a rough couple of weeks, but eventually I started to sleep normally. I recommend trying benedryl as a sleep aid.

I only found out about his condition a little over a month ago and since then I've gotten him access to his phone and computer (he's been locked out of everything and forgot all his passwords) but I can only come visit and spend time with him every so often. He was the one in the house who handled all the electronic and internet stuff, he was also the main caretaker of his brother who has level 3 Autism, so you can imagine the toll this has taken on his family (R and his brother are in their 30s). His mom tells me he is very stubborn and prideful, wanting to do things himself, and also quick to getting frustrated about things (but I think the frustration is mostly due to being locked out of his game accounts, I had to wait a month in order to reset his e-mail password to recover the other accounts). He also gets frustrated when he can't communicate to us exactly what he's thinking.

I guess my question to any caregivers here is, if you've also had restricted access to a victim, what kind of exercises have you done that you felt were very impactful? When I go and visit it's with my girlfriend and we just try to do whatever he wants to do. He's usually showing me different video games and enjoys watching us playing them; I've been able to get him to laugh a lot. Today, I got his Netflix back up so we were watching some anime as well. I asked his mom about the exercises the nurses gave him to do but she says she doesn't/can't really force him to do it.

Thank you anybody for taking the time to read this, I've already done some research and looked through this sub a bit so maybe I'm just wanting to vent as well as looking for advice. I've known my friend R my entire life, as our moms were good friends, and although this is nothing compared to what he is going through, this is probably the most pain I've ever felt in my life.",2020-07-10 17:07:12+00:00,"['Firstly what a wonderful friend you are. You are definitely going to be a shining light on your friend‚Äôs recovery.\n\nHusband suffered a stroke at 36, left side impacted. What really got him going was a big goal - for him, it was to complete a 5km (3.1mile) marathon. That motivated him to really push in his movement goals. \n\nA year after his stroke, he completed the marathon, and out did his goal by not using a walking aid at all.\n\nA lot of people say have small goals along the way but I think some people work better having a bigger objective to spur them.\n\nAll the best with your friend‚Äôs recovery.', 'I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to your friend.

It\'s also normal for this to manifest as anger: it took me a few months to realize that the reason I was angry all the time was not that people were mistreating me, it was that I was angry at myself. One remembers the things one used to be able to do and gets angry that one can\'t still do them.\n\nLetting go of the anger involves a certain amount of accepting ""this is the way things are right now"" (not that you have to accept that nothing will ever improve, but you have to accept that this is how it is *right now*), finding ways to get around your problems (can\'t use your hands? Get voice controlled things.), and working to improve the things you can improve.\n\nI recommend you get him an Amazon Alexa. Look at the Echo Show 5, it\'s relatively cheap and has a screen and camera. Get one for yourself too. The goal here is dual: you\'ll be able to video chat with him daily, and he\'ll be able to voice-control the thing so he doesn\'t have to use his hands. (It\'s also great speech practice, because you have to say the right thing and say it reasonably clearly or it won\'t understand.) He\'ll be able to listen to music, listen to audio books (Alexa can read anything in his Kindle library), and watch videos. Bring it to him in person and set it up for him so he doesn\'t have to. If he doesn\'t have an Amazon account, ask if he\'s willing to let you have the account info for one you set up for him, so you can add books and movies to it for him. \n\nOnce you can video chat him daily, ask him each day about doing his exercises. That\'s the best thing that will help him get back the physical skills he doesn\'t have now.

I understand the situation but incentivizing him doing the exercises may help.  I have MS and that‚Äôs how I hit my head and had my strokes a year ago in my mid-thirties.  There‚Äôs always hope.  I was told I could never run again and it only made my stubborn ass work harder. I really think in this case using what he loves as a reward for doing exercises may work.  If it doesn‚Äôt well then at least everyone knows they did everything they could.  It sounds like Mom is exhausted and gave up and is now just placating him.  You may be better at talking to her and try bringing up rewarding him.  No doctor should be restricting video games unless he has a seizure disorder as well.  It may improve dexterity in his arms and hands.

7 months ago my boyfriend (24m) suffered an ischemic stroke caused by a blood clotting disorder. It shocked all of us. 7 months out and he's doing really well. He's walking without any assistance (other than a foot brace), and his speech is very good.  He's continuing therapy (but only once a week now since insurance won't cover it anymore) and he sees a personal trainer once a week as well. The only things now are that his right side is still numb for the most part (he can feel if you really grip or dig in to anything on his right side) and the mental toll that it has taken on him.

He has his good days and his bad days, but I know he's very depressed and feels hopeless in all of this. Even more so because his life is just starting, and the reality of having to live with his parents again after being out of his own for a while. I try my best to be  supportive of him, but sometimes I'm met with aggression. I can't imagine what he must be feeling, but when he's feeling down it's like a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. If I say something, he shoots everything I say down.

Whatever you do know that he isn‚Äôt mad at you, his consciousness is in turmoil,  his moods are flying back and forth as his brain attempts to make sense of his situation. Small inputs lead to huge reactions because the balancing and filtering system is damaged. The smallest noise or frustration can release a surge of adrenaline and cause the panicked mind to lash out at anything available...which unfortunately is the person that‚Äôs trying to help him the most. Please just be patient with him. As hard as it is, try not to react with anger, just compassion. He‚Äôll improve with time as his systems stabilize and his brain rebuilds the pathways that filter all the tiny frustrations of being a human. \n  There really isn‚Äôt much the medical industry can do to help stroke survivors. They‚Äôre very pharmaceutically driven and drugs can‚Äôt fix a damaged brain. I strongly recommend the book The Brains Way of Healing by Norman Doidge.

There‚Äôs a lot of research on this but the actual process by which it works is little understood. I just know it does. I still listen for about an hour each day. Read up on the Mozart effect.  It works. Meditation is also very helpful. His brain needs quiet time to rebuild and meditation provides that. I use the Monroe institute Stroke Recovery guided meditation. You can download it. I also bought 620nm red light for photobiomodulation therapy as well. Do a search on it and you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs well researched with several peer reviewed journal articles demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting the brain in the rewiring process.

549,My eating habits led me to a stroke,11,coirf3,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/coirf3/my_eating_habits_led_me_to_a_stroke/,3," I was asked by someone on the LoseIt sub-Reddit to post my story here.  I didn't even know that this sub-Reddit existed, so thanks for steering me here, kind stranger.  This was my post:

""At my highest, I weighed 331 pounds (F/59-year-old/5'9). I have diabetes (for the past 8 years), high blood pressure, acid reflux, and sleep apnea. As hard as it may be to believe, I was actually controlling my blood sugar, just with a lot of insulin. I ate pretty much whatever I wanted, sometimes giving a half-hearted attempt at losing weight.

On July 1, I had two strokes. They were the TIA (transcient ischemic attacks, also known as ""mini strokes"" or ""warning strokes"") kinds of strokes. They were 8 hours apart. I was hospitalized for 4 days/3 nights. Through an MRI, they were able to see the strokes, plus an additional 2 ""old strokes"" that I had had without even knowing it.

They say that many people who decide to lose weight have an ""aha"" moment -- the moment that finally leads them to make the necessary changes to commit to living a healthier lifestyle. Well, my aha moment was the strokes.

I have started losing weight (19.1 pounds down in 4 weeks), have been put on medication to control my platelets from stacking into clots, high blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, and aspirin. I have been exercising almost every day. We have gotten rid of all of the junk food from the house. We are doing low-carb and low-calorie meals (I use the My Fitness Pal program)."" (end of post)

I know my experience with the TIA's is nowhere \*near\* as scary and serious as those who have had a major stroke, but I just wanted to let you know that I had a wake-up call and it has given me the motivation to make permanent changes.  I have a long road ahead of me but I am very hopeful that I can succeed.  

I asked my doctor what caused my strokes and he said that the greatest risk factor that I (personally) had was diabetes.  I feel like a walking time-bomb at times but I feel like I am doing everything that I can to lessen my chances of having another stroke.  Reading stories posted by you all here is another reminder that no matter how difficult losing weight can be at times, I need to (I \*have\* to) keep trying.",2019-08-10 14:33:00+00:00,"['There are some inspirational stories about the benefits of low carb on r/keto that you might like.

550,Nintendo Game that seems to be good for my son with Aphasia,11,co6v98,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/co6v98/nintendo_game_that_seems_to_be_good_for_my_son/,5,"My 20 year old son had a stroke almost exactly 2 weeks ago.  Needless to say it has been a shock to our whole family.  

However, we consider ourselves so fortunate that the damage the stroke did appears to be contained to just the language parts of the brain.  His major motor skills, fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, etc.. seem to have been largely unaffected.

So the condition he suffers from is called Aphasia and I am certain that almost all of you are already familiar with this condition.  If you have not, Aphasia does not affect intelligence but is generally just a language related issue.

Nevertheless, he has been discharged from the hospital and it has been slow and frustrating process to get this therapy lined up.  Because we did not want to waste any time starting we have taken on the task of trying to help him ourselves with the help of Aphasia workbooks and materials.  A few were even provided by the ST that he saw while in the hospital.

So that brings me to the whole point of my post.  During this process I have discovered a Nintendo Switch game that I think is really great for him.

[https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/word-puzzles-by-powgi-switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/word-puzzles-by-powgi-switch)

The game is actually 6 word games in one.  It helps with reading, word recall, divergent naming (words can come in categories), spelling, etc..   It somehow manages to do all this without being a kid's game and without being too difficult for him either.

I know that Aphasia has many sub-types and I don't claim to be an expert by any means but at least for my son this seems to be working great as a supplement to our other materials.  It is great to give him a little change of pace when he needs it.

I hope it helps someone else out there.

I know its because of the part of my brain that was damaged, but its still weird to keep having to remind myself that I can't get back to working on my PhD or get a job right away, because I get super tired and need a nap after 2 hours of working very hard on anything.  Its very hard for me, becuase I spent so much time doing stuff, and working before this, and now its really hard for me to read and write for more then ten or twenty minutes at a go.  I also can't watch an entire movie, if I haven't seen it before or more than an episode or two of a tv show I've never seen.  I've watched Big Mouth on Netflix like 9 times since I had the stroke, because I know I can manage it.

I'm just getting frustrated.  I know it hasn't been very long since I had the stroke, and I know it will take years for me to get back to where I was, if I ever do, but it gets very frustrating when I can't remember that something is hard for me, or I think I can just do something then when I start, I remember that I'm not very capable of doing it right now.  I don't know if anyone else feels that way.  To meet me I seem fairly normal and like I'm totally fine, but then I can't do stuff.  Sometimes I wish I had a more obvious physical issue so people won't just think I'm lazy or something.  Its also a problem of having to much time on my hands is that I spend way to much thinking about all my issues and problems.

Oh well hopefully things will start to improve sooner rather than later, but I know I will be able to get back to doing the things I love at some point.  My latest MRI shows that I'm healing well.  So that's a plus and I won't be on the medication that is making my mood swings worse and increasing my fatigue levels.

560,My stroke story,12,25gnoj,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/25gnoj/my_stroke_story/,3,"First time post, long time lurker here. I have seen more than one post about comas in the last hour, and well, I'm here to tell you they suck. I don't know if anyone will even read this, don't really care,but some part of me must hope or I wouldn't waste time posting. My father suffered a major stroke in October 2012. A surgeon performed brain surgery to release the clots in his brain which caused said stroke. I have never been very religious, and after being told that the surgery was successful, however he the chances of him ever waking up were slim to none, I was horrified. I had been reading to him, and hoping that somehow he could here me. I now know thst he could. This was a man who got up at 5 am everyday and went to work, no matter how he felt. After 3 days of sitting by his bed, talking to him, begging for a slight movement to tell us he still in there, we got nothing. I did what any normal person would do, I turned to my god. I walked to the chapel with my mother, sat down, and gave my father and his situation to God. I will never forget what happened next. We walked back into his room, and as he lay there motionless, I stared out the window. I said out loud I need a sign. And as I turned my head, my father raised his arm off the bed like he was reaching for something.I ran over, and held that hand for what seemed like hours. Slowly, over the next week, he began to squeeze our hands, open an eye, and mouths words. He was transferred to OKC to a veterans hospital, and I'll never forget the day I walked in, and he started talking. ""This is all a dream. Why did you leave me here? Please be real. Are you real? Don't leave me. Take me home."" He had a traekeotomy tube, and a feeding tube in his stomach, his entire left side was paralyzed, and there was nothing I could do but just be there. And that's when they told me that it was time to discharge him. I had taken care of everything from the day of his stroke, veteran benefits (which didn't come close to covering full time nursing care), I was his p.o.a., so I did the only thing I knew was right. I brought my father home. Had all the necessary equipment, supplies, most importantly being love.my mother and my brother and I became his nurses. He was happy to be home abd with his family, but he was miserable. His body was broken, and so was his mind. It was my son's birthday, and the biggest and best toy was from his paw paw Charlie. He crawled up in his hospital bed and hugged his grandpa, and although only the right side of his mouth curled, it was the first smile I had seen reach his eyes since that day in october. This was January 12th. The next evening he started to complaib about shoulder pain. And I could tell he had pulled a muscle pulling himself up with his right arm with the hoist above the bed. The next 24 hours are still a blur to me. We had to call an ambulance, and after getting to the hospital he looked me in the eye and said"" she x-rayed the wrong arm."" Now, I knew something was wrong because the arm he was referring to was supposed to be paralyzed. However, we were discharged. I can't tell you why I didn't make a scene to where they understood I knew something wasn't right. I should have. My father was having a heart attack in the ambulance ride home. I kept taking his blood pressure, every time it got lower, and he was getting colder. By the time the ambulance arrived back, he had bottomed out. I was doing everything I could, using oxygen, blankets, my own body heat, but it was too late. His last words were "" babygirl."" By the time we got back to the hospital, a crash cart wasn't going to do anything but prolong what we all knew was going to happen. My little brother had been holding on to him so tight, and refusing to give it up to anyone but himself.So my father chose to go when no one else was in the room but him. He couldn't fight any longer, as much as he wanted to. He had lasted exactly a week at home. He got to see my son's birthday. I took care of all the funeral arrangements, and although I will probably owe them for years, I had to be the one to tske responsibility. It was always me. He raised me to do just that. It has been a year and a half, and I'm still processing all that happened in those short 3 months. I learned so much about my father, my family, and myself. I wouldn't take back the moments we shared that seemed to matter most, because they did. If you made it this far, thank you. This is my story. I had to share, and it's taken me this long to be able to. I can look back now and know I did right by him. I don't blame myself so much, on the good days. I take nothing for granted anymore.

Another 2 weeks in a rehab facility. He is physically weak, but no right or left side impairment. Just physically weak. His short term memory is very poor. He does recognize us and can hold decent conversations but occasionally goes into periods of ‚ÄúCrazy Talk‚Äù. He does remember passwords, medications he is on, etc. 

He is home now with my mother, also 78. When we checked him out of rehab we felt fairly good about his progress and agreed he was ready to go home with minimal assistance using a walker. When we got home 3 days ago though it has been quite a different story. He doesn‚Äôt understand he had a stroke and is resistant to any assistance walking or using the bathroom. He does not listen to us like he did the nurses at rehab. He has had 2 minor falls. We have realized it‚Äôs not possible for Mom to handle this alone until/if he improves and becomes stronger. Medicare will pay for 20 days in a nursing facility but we feel that would set him back mentally and wouldn‚Äôt lessen the fall risk to be honest. 

He is a Veteran so we are working with the VA to get help. (The VA moves slow) Also looking into private personal care ASAP so someone can be there to lend a hand and watch him. My parents don‚Äôt have a ton of money but we can definitely cover a few months of the cost and reevaluate then. In the meantime family members are taking turns sleeping and staying there to watch him day and night. If he has to use the bathroom he will get up and doesn‚Äôt want any help or the walker and you have to be very vigilant and he can become combative verbally. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for by making this post. My shift staying at my parents house is this coming Wednesday through Saturday, but I can‚Äôt sleep well at home now as I‚Äôm terrified the phone is going to ring and he will have had a bad fall despite someone sleeping next to him. 

I have acute anxiety and I worry this could cause me to have a stress related heart attack which would certainly compound the problem. I am working with my therapist weekly and my psychiatrist is adjusting my medication, so I hope I will be fine and can figure out the best way to help my parents.

So, I was in the ICU for the first two weeks, mostly so the could get me stabilized on heparin then transitioned to Lovenox ( both anticoagulants). Been in an acute rehab facility the last three weeks. I initially had basically zero use of my left arm and was very unstable on my feet. I‚Äôve since learned to walk without any aid and have nearly 100% movement in my arm, though finer motor control is still a major issue and the arm is still very, very weak. I‚Äôm scheduled to be discharged to home this week, though I‚Äôve been lobbying for a one week extension as I know I‚Äôm not going to get nearly the level of therapy at home that  I‚Äôm getting here (4 hours per day). Focusing on staying positive (not easy sometimes) and seeing this as a challenge. I‚Äôve come a long way, but still have much work to do. I feel like I have a 90% chance of getting back to 90% of my pre-stroke self within 9 months, at least that‚Äôs my goal.

EDIT: After reading this again, I felt I should clarify something. When I say I have 100% movement in my arm, what I mean is that I can actively and voluntarily move each muscle group. Which is good. It does not mean I have fully restored movement ( not even close at this point).",2021-10-19 12:35:30+00:00,"['have an exercise regime at home and stick to it.

My mom (67) wasn‚Äôt aware of the signs immediately, so by the time he arrived at the hospital, his speech was significantly slurred and he couldn‚Äôt walk. He was fortunate to not endure any other health complications associated to the stroke. After being hospitalized, he stayed in a rehab center for as long as insurance would allow (I believe it was 3-4 weeks or so). Once discharged, he received in-home PT and OT throughout the week, again, until insurance said no more. 

Since then (April/May 2021), he has not received any form of therapy because my mom feels that getting him to outpatient care is too difficult. I told her that I can help her in any way that I can, including assisting with taking him to PT appointments. She tells me that she doesn‚Äôt want my dad to have a bathroom accident there, and that it would be a huge hassle. We go back and forth regarding options, and she shuts them all down.

My dad is very passive, so he has never spoken up to my mom about his own feelings. I‚Äôm unsure whether or not he wants to seek further treatment, and if I asked him, I know that he will say he‚Äôs fine where he is, regardless of how he actually feels.

(If you fall asleep and drop a paper book... sometimes a page gets wrinkled. That\'s all.) \n2. Spelling was hard. I used to be extraordinarily good at spelling - in fact when I was a kid, the state champion speller used to ask \\*me\\* how to spell things. (My spelling was amazing. My ability to perform in a spelling bee less so.) After my stroke, it\'s gone, I can\'t remember how to spell everything and I have to ask Alexa often. This is still true.\n3. Typing is hard. I have nerve damage in one hand, and a couple fingers didn\'t work at all for a while after my stroke and I\'ll probably never be able to feel with them properly again, so I had to teach myself to type with my right hand and my left index finger, and my error rate when I first came home was 3 errors per word. (It\'s still pretty high when I\'m tired, like now.) \n4. My problem was that I\'d know there was a word for something, but I couldn\'t recall it. The way I describe it is, imagine if inside your mind is a set of shelves full of words, so when you need a word your brain takes the concept and looks up the word and pulls it off the shelf and you say it, but many of my words were missing, so for example I might know that there is a word for the color of the sky but when I go to pull it off the shelf... it\'s not there and I\'m mentally fumbling around for it while instead of ""blue"" my mouth is saying ""uh... uh... uh... that thing, you know, the way the sky looks during the daytime when there aren\'t any clouds, you know?"" so any word game would just make me angry with myself for my inability to remember basic stuff. (I literally couldn\'t remember left from right for a while. I couldn\'t remember my favorite author\'s name. I could imagine her face in vivid detail but I couldn\'t remember her name. A lot of basic stuff was gone.) \n5. If you had found something I could handle, I would have been very angry with myself for not being able to do much more. I was a very smart guy once and it made me angry to be forced to realize I wasn\'t any more.\n\nSo for me at least, a tablet word game would have been an exercise in frustration and anger.

Anyway, I had a hemorrhagic stroke caused by a congenital CCM/Cavernous Malformation on  June 8, 2021 at the age of 27. My entire left side (arm and leg) were paralyzed. As I sit typing this, I‚Äôm a little over 3 months out from the stroke and I have made huge strides in terms of recovery. My left leg is pretty much at 100% and I jog a couple of miles every other night. And while my left arm/hand have certainly come a long way from where they were, they‚Äôre not fully healed yet, though my doctors and therapists assure me that they fully expect me to make a ‚Äúfull recovery.‚Äù

I say all of that just for background, so I hope it doesn‚Äôt come off as anything more than that. My question is geared more towards those stroke survivors that were pretty serious weightlifters- while I understand that I‚Äôm still fairly early into my stroke recovery, I have yet to be able to ‚Äúfeel the squeeze‚Äù/noticeably contract my left pectoral muscle, left bicep and tricep, Lats, Rear Delts and Traps. If anyone has had a similar experience like that, my question is, ‚Äúhow long did it take for that ability to return?‚Äù I understand that everyone‚Äôs recovery is different, so there is no exact answer.

580,What happened to me?,10,p9upd6,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/p9upd6/what_happened_to_me/,8,"Long story. 

Healthy, active otherwise normal 31 year old male. I take lithium and seroquil for depression and anxiety that was in remission prior to ""the incident"". I had made a recent change to my diet to include high amounts of red meat to go on the carnivore diet, supposedly, but still kept a bunch of carbs and vice items. I did and still go to hot yoga multiple times weekly. I was also on a plant based medicine journey starting in Aug 2020 to April 2021 that included kambo every 30-45 days (3-4 points - relatively small number) and microdosing tiny amounts of psilocybin (october- january) and LSD (jan-march). I trust this shaman and met her via a friend's referral and consider her a quite trustworthy, wise, and intuitive figure. I was getting into shadow work like material which is ugly but necessary to grow and emerge from past trauma.

I work as an electrician and give work my all. Sometimes too much. 90% of my life is work to save up for some unknown someday. It started as a normal day in April and I got home early at 4pm. I had a headache , which is not unusual. The office dispatched me back out to help a coworker around the corner from where i live. I got up from decompressing and begrudgingly headed out, determined to solve my notoriously incompetant coworker's problem. He was doing a panel change at a house and the grounding and bonding still wasnt done,  so i take it upon myself to finish the task. I stuck the 8 ft steel ground rod in and it went in about a foot. I wasn't going to be able to do this by hand, so i grabbed the relatively heavy and unwieldy rotary hammer to pound it in. Normally i grab a ladder to work from above but somehow i stood up the machine so it landed on the rod and i squeezed the trigger. It was really noisy and i didnt have my ear protection on me, so i twisted my head into my shoulder and covered  the other ear while i strained to reach the trigger. The ground rod went in after about 2 minutes but i felt a sudden onset of a zoomed out or disassociated type feeling on the left side of my left eye and a stronger headache  in my third eye area. I have felt similar when i work too hard in the heat and need to slow down, but the effect on the eye was distinctly new. I noticed  something was off with my vision but continued to drive the second rod in and scurry under the house to connect the ground wire to the water pipe. I did so almost by feel since my vision was thrown off. It was a hot, sunny day for april here and of course im dehydrated and not taking care of myself. I go home still feeling off and hoping it will clear the next day. 

It didnt.

By day 3, i began panicking and thought something really got damaged. I assumed it was my hearing and I felt guilty for not wearing protection. I tried listening to my music but couldnt ""feel it"", so it must be my hearing. But the drill could not be that loud. My hearing was professionally tested and came back normal. I described dizziness and the dr said that was not normal. My stress hormones were flaring up all day every day and I couldnt focus on my personal life and work performance degraded. I apologized to customers and retold the scenario as if to justify them noticing how off I felt.

Extreme panic set in and i would wake up at 3 in the morning and just pace back in forth in my room. Blaming myself for being so reckless. Not knowing what really happened. Wondering if it would be permanent. Fear of worst case scenario that i finally ""got what was coming to me"" after years of abusing my body. Immediately jumping to the conclusion this would last forever and I didnt want to live so disassociated from everything. I went back to all of the things i enjoyed like techno music, spiritual books, and yoga class (which had been my absolute ANCHOR for 3 years and always helped reset my mood) and found that everything felt different and disassociated. The sparks of joy and emotional sharpness just werent there anymore. It seemed as if I was stuck in time and the world was moving on.

Suicidal ideation became stronger and after 9 days after the incident,  I decided to go to urgent care for a mental health eval, then the ER, and then after a long night was referred to inpatient psychiatric care. There was only one place open out of 9 that they called and this one was not connected to other advanced facilities, like the others. I had been before once in 2017 but for completely different reasons. I was terrified i was losing my grip on this life and wanted to end it to escape this horrible, alienating feeling. The doctors all ran basic tests but I got the impression they thought this was a completely mental issue triggered by stress and an overreaction to something. I sat there for 4 days moderately trying to restore my sanity so I could leave on time for an upcoming ENT appointment. Ultimately, i do not think the inpatient care at this facility was helpful and i left with a sizeable bill. There are people that truly need what they offer, but it wasnt me. Thank God for good insurance.

I went to the ENT and my ears eyes and throat all looked normal. I tested positive for a mild dizziness related symptom but it fell within the range of normal. She confirmed no hearing damage and I got a bolt of confidence that i was fine and could be myself again. I thought it was BPPV or ear crystals that misalign on ocassion, causing vertigo. Unfortunately i was now hyperfocusing in on my left ear that kept making squishy/clicking noises. After several days, it didnt go away, meaning it could not be BPPV. I noticed a sensation on my left face that traveled from my left neck up to my left eye, but i couldnt define it as either pressure or numbness Got referred to a physical therapist.

I have a psychologist who has known me via zoom for over a year and he seems to think this is all a form of ptsd. Others say this is a pivotal transition and a growth exercise. 

The physical therapist did multiple evaluations, including one with special goggles that ruled out involuntary eye movements. He mentioned I described a lot of stroke-like symptoms but if it was a true stroke, there would be things I could not control that would be obvious identifiers. I was hyper stressed and my performance on some basic exercises was moderately reduced from what i inagine it would have been in times prior. I was doubting my body's own ability to perform basic functions. Meanwhile, i am still about to thrive and all the difficult stuff I do at my job despite feeling incredibly disassociated. Driving seems more strenuous and ""by muscle memory "". Work has become my life because all else seems to be in disorder.

I had a breakthrough shortly after in yoga, where I successfully did a new head stand. I must have found some way to drop the stress reflex because I could actually look at the people in the class and see their faces clearly. My parents had visited the month prior and i felt i could not see their faces clearly and felt continuously dizzy.

I was still noticing a weird feeling in my throat and a general disassociated sensation coming from my left face. I booked an appointment with a neurologist and he was like ""why are you here?"" but believed my story and set me up with an MRI scan. The scan revealed a 4x4x4mm cavernous malformation and an associated developmental vein anomoly on the right frontal lobe. Supposedly this has been there since birth but it's possible it could affect something. 1 in 100 people get them. No infarctions or evidence of true stroke was found, but it had now beenc3 months. I was referred to a vascular specialist who i have not seen yet.

I saw an eye specialist who tested my eyes and they no longer are 20/20, like they were last October. I have developed or already had a very mild nystagmus in my right eye. The dr says often times this is controlled by a sort of mental override but when the mind becomes stressed, that mechanism deteriorates. I got a prescription for glasses to take a load off my mind.

I am just baffled and confused and bewildered as to what happened and why my own body just feels so.. off. All the time. Every day. Things just are not felt clearly like they were before. The derealization. The depersonalization. I see things but dont ""see"" them. Art is difficult to appreciate. My eyes seem to skip around and life lacks vividness. I no longer feel completely engaged with my surroundings. Night vision is off. I struggle to see the stars on a clear night like I did with my parents last November. I broke through a psychological low I have never been to and requested all of this medical help, which makes me think I am a hypochondriac and that everything is mental. I just dont know. I have no answers.


My gut feeling is this was a vertebral artery dissection - a rare but common stroke among younger people. It can be missed on the MRI. It left a bunch of chaos in its wake and I am constantly adapting to my new reality. People who know me cant tell i am different. I try hard to maintain normalcy. Every day us a struggle to find the motivation to thrive again. I have to rediscover what I find meaningful today in this new body.

The best we can do is say that what you describe would be very atypical for stroke.\n\nA point of clarification and some good news. Vertebral artery dissections are not strokes in themselves, but they‚Äôre a mechanism which can *cause* stroke. Regardless, most strokes show up pretty vividly on MRI. Very rarely, a stroke can be so small that it isn‚Äôt picked up on MRI. However, strokes in the distribution of the vertebral arteries don‚Äôt cause lack of motivation, depersonalization, or derealization. Especially not a stroke that is so small it can‚Äôt even be picked up on MRI. \n\nDerealization, depersonalization, things lacking vividness are all classic symptoms of depression. People with anxiety can also get a hyperawareness syndrome that can *mess* with a person and lead to a whole host of symptoms. (I often think of this as the hyperawareness that comes with PTSD, but focused on a person‚Äôs body instead of on their environment.)\n\nOne thing that‚Äôs always good to emphasize: depression and anxiety are only ‚Äúin your head‚Äù in the sense that that‚Äôs where the brain is located. The brain isn‚Äôt special, it is an organ that runs on chemicals just like every other organ. When your pancreas can‚Äôt make enough insulin, that‚Äôs diabetes. And when your brain can‚Äôt make enough serotonin, that‚Äôs depression. \n\nI‚Äôm so glad you have a good support network. I believe in you.

I also had mild anxiety before my stroke, but since have had to be put on anxiety medication and am struggling with depression and the appropriate treatment for that. So I don't doubt what you went through could have heightened any mental stuff you had going on. If you had a stroke though, I feel like it would have shown up on your MRI.

The doctors were very pessimistic about my dad‚Äôs quality of life. The thing I‚Äôm most scared about is the aphasia and how severe it will be. I‚Äôm so scared and heartbroken at the idea that he might not only struggle with speaking, but also not understand what we are saying. I‚Äôm praying it won‚Äôt be severe, but if you have experience this yourself or you have had a loved one go through this, what was most helpful to get through this? 

Also, if you were sedated for awhile after your stroke, what was most helpful for you that family members did? I‚Äôm writing this as I am holding my dad‚Äôs hand.

I can relate to your state of uncertainty and fear of what to do next when doctors are giving you updates. I understand your fear of the future, of your dads future, how other relatives are going to grieve through this you are going through something really really hard. \n \nI also feel like the doctors job is to prepare you and your family for the worst, so it‚Äôs important to ask the right questions that NO young person has any idea what to ask. It but my family in the ass when we were being told that my dad wasn‚Äôt gonna make it past 48 hours and he was gonna have another stroke. You gotta ask them about options for his road to recovery (short term respite care, long term care, nursing home opportunities, recreational therapy, physical, occupational and speech therapy) leading all of that to the fact that you have an occupation (stay at home parent, full time worker, whatever it is you also do). I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say in this ramble is as much as doctors wanna prepare you for the worst, like death, what you should do that I wish that I did when my dad had his stroke is to ask ALL the questions you can think of if your dad ends up surviving. To be really honest with you, the first few months after he comes back from the hospital could get abysmal before they get better. \n\nYour dads right side was affected, which caused challenge of his speech, or aphasia. Some things to practice when helping someone with severe aphasia is talking slowly, but not talking down.

If you‚Äôre talking to your dad, make sure to maintain eye contact so you can read each other‚Äôs lips. And SPEECH THERAPY!

I hope you get the right help you and your family need. It‚Äôs going to be hard, impossible a lot of times.

First let me just say, the more you walk on curled toes without taking steps (no pun intended) to fix it, the more neuroplasticity makes that your new normal because with every step you are telling your brain that this is how your foot is supposed to be.  \n\nI bet you've tried to manually uncurl your toes, even spent hours bending it backwards in frustration hoping that it would take, i used to be the same way. But we've been going about this all wrong, you can't isolate a muscle group anymore. Why? Because all of your muscles on your leg are attached, from your ass to the tip of your toes. That's why when spasticity kicks in your leg becomes stiff as a board without the brains ability to regulate it. So what do we do? Stretch... lengthen your muscles and engage in the muscle in a way that is not detrimental to progress.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAAXGK/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_image\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAAXGK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nThere is a bunch of different kinds but the design principal is the same.

Start the furthest away and work you way down.\n\nHamstring 3X day/ 60 sec\n\nCalves 3X day/60 sec\n\nAchilles 3X day/ 60 sec\n\nNext you want to think about what triggers your hammer toes? For me it was any type of stimulation to that part of the body, the second i take two steps my toes would curl. So my solution is to stand in place and weight bare stimulating the muscle groups you use to walk, look down and make sure your toes aren't underneath your foot and put in reps so that neuroplasticity can take hold. \n\nStretching and weight bearing is so important, it is literally the key to everything because you can't do anything if your body is stiff as a board.

* Is it as effective or more so then baclofen?
* Does the strength of the botox last the entire 3 months before you have to go back for another injection?
* I somewhat rely on my spasticity to walk as it engages my muscles by default, is the Botox so strong that your muscles would completely relax?

Sadly, we haven't had any real movement from her right arm so botox was discontinued when she left rehabilitation.  So I can't answer if it would make that appendage completely relaxed to the point of not useful or just allow movement. \n\n\nIf you can get botox without breaking the bank, I would recommend trying it. Once my girlfriend can walk again, we are going to take her to get it administered again.

The Botox makes a big difference in her comfort level, though I don't sense it improves motility or anything like that. Mostly just relaxes her toes and such so that walking is more comfortable.

Yeah, that was a little bit of a stretch. 

A lack of exercise or physical activity is one of the top 10 risk factors for stroke. But exercise doesn't necessarily mean that you have to go out and run a marathon. If we know anything about stroke recovery, it's that it's different for every person.

Moving more can be a complicated issue if you're dealing with pain, fatigue, or one-sided weakness.

It's important to find ways to move more but in ways that take into consideration any issues, you may still be dealing with post-stroke. For example, you could try seated yoga or tai chi exercises, dust areas of your home, sweep the floor, etc.

598,OT Tip: W is for...,10,np51qj,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/np51qj/ot_tip_w_is_for/,0,"**W is for weakness.**  
**‚Äã**  
**‚Äã**One-sided weakness, or hemiparesis, is a common symptom after a stroke. When a stroke happens in the left hemisphere of the brain, the weakness will present on the right side of the body, and vice versa when a stroke happens in the right hemisphere.

But why does this happen?

The reason weakness happens this way is because the pathways that carry motor information **cross** from one side to the other. We have several motor pathways that come down from the primary motor cortex of our brain. The lateral corticospinal tract is one of the main pathways that controls limb movements. Around 90% of it crosses to the opposite side of the brainstem. It then continues down to the spinal cord and our muscles so that we can produce movement.

So to try and break this down, when someone has a right-sided stroke (right brain), they'll have left-sided weakness. The right side of the brain controls the movements of the left side of the body (with some exceptions). This is because the motor pathway starts on one side of the brain, crosses at the brainstem, and then serves the opposite side of the body.

To help you visualize this, the image below shows the brain and spinal cord, and how the lateral corticospinal tract exits the spinal cord on the opposite side from which it started.

My mom was in the hospital two weeks ago for major surgery. She's doing okay! Along the entire journey from the initial consultation with the surgeon to discharge, I made sure to ask (and encouraged Mom to ask) all the questions I could think of.

When we understand more about what's going on with our body and why certain treatments do or don't work for us, we're more likely to follow through with suggestions.

Hi everyone,
So my dad had a very severe hemorrhage stroke about 2 years ago, and even to this date, his memory is super bad, have left neglect, cannot move his left hand and arm at all, and can‚Äôt walk, and can‚Äôt really control his left leg. 
I‚Äôve been helping him do standing exercises to try to strengthen his left leg, but I‚Äôm getting very frustrated and very tired and do not see any hope whatsoever. I‚Äôm constantly very sad whenever I see him zooming out when I talk to him, and never seem to try to stand up straighter or try to learn to do something to improve..


I hate to see him having to live in long term care for the rest of his life. I regret so much for saving him back then, and I cry myself to sleep every other day after coming home from his place. I‚Äôve been seeing him and caring for his every single day since his stroke 2 years ago, but soon I will be going back to school, and it‚Äôs not possible for me to visit and help him exercise or brush his teeth anymore.

A home exercise program is important and is usually a very structured way to work on stroke recovery at home. But what if therapists encouraged survivors to explore limitations, strengths, mood and emotion, and spirituality through creative pursuits?

I was reading an [article on creative arts-based therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158307/) which is what inspired me to talk about hobbies as therapy yesterday. I want to take that idea a bit further.

Creative arts-based therapy not only addresses physical limitations, but things like music therapy and dancing have been shown to cause positive brain changes. Observing and contemplating visual art has been shown to improve spatial perception. Creating visual art can be a way to non-verbally express feelings and process complicated emotions.

Even if you don't have access to an occupational therapist, art therapist, or music therapist, you can still benefit from engaging in something creative. I got some comments yesterday saying that someone saw improved hand movement after returning to quilting and using a loom!

You could start with sketching as that only requires a pencil and paper, or get an adult coloring book and some crayons. Try painting if you have paint and a brush lying around. Listen to different types of music. Belt out your favorite songs. Try to play a musical instrument.

610,I am very nervous,10,luad45,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/luad45/i_am_very_nervous/,5,"Tomorrow I (f22) get to see my mother (62) in-person and have not seen her in-person for the past 52 days. She had a hemorrhagic stroke 80 days ago on December 11th. 

She was in and out of ICU for almost a month then moved to a nursing home where she was under care of a skilled nursing program. Current state code due to COVID prohibits any guests from entering nursing homes and thus why I haven‚Äôt seen her in-person. 

She was found by police around 9am who were called by a concerned coworker. I had found a receipt time stamped at 4:30pm on the 10th so I believe that she may have been down and alone for a maximum of 12 hrs as she was found in her pajamas next to her bed. She had hit her head and they thought that was what caused the brain bleed but the MRI showed two different spots of bleeding on the left side of her brain (subdural hemorrhage & IP hemorrhage).

For first month and up until the last time I saw her she had no movement on the right side of her body and lost her speech. She was also not able to lift herself up in bed and had slept a lot. When she was awake she wasn‚Äôt able to focus due to her midline shifting to her left side.

Her doctor told me that because she was showing little to no progress during her first 20 days that her chances of recovery were low. I believe this is why she was originally placed at the nursing home where she could easily transfer to long-term care.

Fortunately, my mother has been progressing beyond initial belief. She has very little therapy due to the fact that her insurance is not covering. I have had a nightmare of a time applying for Medicaid/disability as I am US based. I‚Äôve also been fighting for her conservatorship and guardianship as we have not discussed something like this before. 

They have decided to move her to a rehab hospital where she can get the in-depth therapy she needs. This move is happening in less than a week.

I have spoken to her a couple times on the phone but her speech has been slowly returning and what she does say is gibberish or sometimes confusing. I believe that she has a strong understanding but cannot communicate what she wants. I know that this is frustrating and I am nervous as to how to speak with her and I want to support her. My mother raised me by herself and we are extremely close. This life changing event has been difficult for us both as I have assumed her finances and moved back into her house.

About 7 years ago I had a stroke in the gym doing deadlifts (I was 23 at the time).

In fairness it was a minor stroke and I recovered almost all of my motor functions, but the doctors could never explain it. I went for many, many tests with nothing unordinary coming out in the results.

Mom had a major stroke, lots of issues but the focus here is her left arm = 100% paralyzed. Her shoulder is drooping down severely, way past anything I can do with my own shoulders. It's allmost like it's falling off.

Shes been in rehab for about a month and a half now and is expected to be in until January as long assuming she doesn't hit a wall in recovery. The problem is I've had a issues with all 3 rehabs we've been to since this all started, each one been bad in different ways but this ones a bit worse than the others. The staff seem to be extremely lazy, I can't even get anyone to pickup the phone without calling back 2-3 times and letting it ring for 5 minutes. Mom claims they arent doing much with her just a very small bit each day, ""they put me in the chair for a couple hours"" kinda thing.   


So, I've been thinking about taking my moms rehab into my own hands. I want to design an *actual* intensive rehab plan and keep her giving 110% until we get to a good place. I'll let the professionals keep doing what htey're doing but want to add this on top.  


My primary goal is to get her to regain at least minor control of her arm, shes in a lot of pain because of the shoulder droop and shes also missing her left leg above the knee from a previous issue that led up to the stroke. I have done a lot of reading and I understand everyone is different which causes stroke recovery to be anywhere between 0-100% on a case by case basis, so I'm wondering what effects my efforts would even have?

If I start and keep doing this will there be a chance it directly benefits the amount of recovery she will get (new nerve and neuron connections etf), or is physical therapy more of a ""try to keep what remains strong"", ""try to avoid other muscles getting worse"" and/or ""we need to find out what your limits are so we can work with them?""",2020-11-06 12:37:45+00:00,"[""YES but I would rather strongly encourage occupational therapy for the upper extremity.  A big problem I find with rehab is that unless you are in an intensive rehab program in a HOSPITAL, the professionals who know how to progress stroke patients appropriately is minimal whether they are an occupational or physical therapist.  They do exist but it requires additional expensive training and experience for the therapist.  I am personally speaking from CA, USA.  \n\nThe other just as large issue is insurance.  Rehabilitation every year gets pressured from insurance companies that cap minutes on patient care that does nothing for recovery so even if they knew what to do, they don't get enough time to do it.  If you are in a SNF, forget it.\n\nYOU need to take charge.  Learn what you can from any therapist and practice that movement with your mom everyday, multiple times a day.  It would be optimal to find a therapist who knows how to tape or brace the arm back into the socket so the ligaments can return to their proper length.  If you feel a space between the shoulder and arm, DO NOT raise the arm above the head, this can cause damage.  Honestly she needs to be assessed to determine if her scapula is moving with the arm among other things.  Weight bearing through the arm and positioning would be my first suggestions.  Find someone who knows how to do this to teach you.\n\nI am sorry that you haven't found better care, I hope at least I pointed you in the right direction.

&#x200B;

Just here for some advice.

&#x200B;

My husband (39yo) had a brain stem stroke on July 28, it was quite extensive and prognosis was very grim at the time. He was in a coma for about 5 days. His mother and I were allowed to see him, and on the second occasion I saw he had opened his eyes, and I tried to communicate with him, so I asked him to blink for me, which he did, and to push down my hand, which he did. A few days after that he was able to move both hands and responded to pain, which is when his neurosurgeon decided to recommend surgery to remove the dead cerebellar tissue that was pressing against the brain stem and thus give him a chance for recovery. He did poorly for a few days after that, so they did a CT scan and found a brain bleed.

They did a ventriculostomy to drain the fluid, and after that I was able to see him again. He eventually woke up, and I was able to communicate with him again, I got him to track my finger, and follow a couple of simple commands (open/close your eyes). I also got him to push down my hand again. The next day a neurologist saw him and found that he could move both hands and even wiggle his toes, nod and shake his head.

But then things started to go awry again. His temp kept going up and his blood pressure and he got hiccups, which they managed by giving him propofol. During this time, all the gains he had showed over a whole week were gone. He is in a persistent vegetative state and will not respond to anything. A couple of weeks after we got to see him on FaceTime, and I thought I got him to respond to a couple of commands, but we weren't sure. The nurses reported that he was not responding to them at all. I interpret this as he's depressed and won't respond to them. Or maybe I'm fooling myself

What I would like to know is this: Is this it? Why was there improvement and why has that improvement been lost? Could it return? One neuro said it might, see what happens over the following 2-4 weeks. A nurse seems convinced it was just random synapses firing, another nurse said it was all reflexive (even following commands???) and an intensivist (who has seen him basically every day) said basically the damage was probably continuing post-stroke. They have done an EEG on him and found he has an awareness level of 5-6 out of 8.

I don't know what to think now. I would like to hear your opinions. Ultimately I know that this is probably it, but I just want time to visit him before I say goodbye. It's just messed up that I cannot visit him every day.",2020-09-05 23:08:06+00:00,"['Hang in there.  Your husband is fighting and he needs to know you‚Äôre fighting with him.

629,My 58 year old stage four cancer survivor father had a stroke yesterday due to chronic issues from radiation therapy... I need advice,10,iifay8,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/iifay8/my_58_year_old_stage_four_cancer_survivor_father/,10,"I am not sure of the exact details as everything has been a blur. I was camping in northern Michigan when my mom called me and told me my father had a stroke. My boyfriend and I, after I had a panic attack on the side of the road, packed up and drove four hours straight to the hospital. He is doing well and recovering, but his speech is affected. He had stage four throat cancer in 2010 and went into remission later on after intensive chemo and radiation treatment. His current medical doctors said that it looks like his body built a collateral system around one of the major arteries to his brain because it had collapsed most likely due to his radiation treatments. That collateral system has been keeping him alive but he had a stroke on the other side.

&#x200B;

My father is a veteran, and while he was a marine stationed in the Philippines he and the other members of the troop were exposed to and drank contaminated water. Years after he went into remission my mother finally found out after doing immense amounts of research that the US government was fully aware of the toxic state of the water their troops were being exposed to and this is most likely what caused my father, a man who has never smoked a day in his life, to develop stage four throat cancer. My mom dug deeper and found out that many of his troop had developed similar cancers or other afflictions. 

&#x200B;

I am not pointing any fingers or trying to place blame on anyone, I am just struggling with seeing my father, the strongest man I have ever met, physically and mentally, weakened and frustrated at not being able to even speak correctly. It is absolutely heart breaking. I know when he comes home we will need to do a lot of things to improve his health (even though aside from his high blood pressure, he is already fairly healthy) and I am wondering, since I live with him, how I can help. I cook for my parents, so I would especially appreciate recipes that are great for people post-stroke. Any moral support is welcomed as well,

630,Hearing Success stories,11,ibpxw3,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ibpxw3/hearing_success_stories/,13,"Hello Everyone,

Just a brief summary, my mom (67) had a major bleed  (Nov 2019) as a result of blood thinners for her Atrial Fibrillation A-Fib. She had to go through surgery which was successful and her heart went back into normal rhythm but the bleed resulted in paralysis in her right side.

Thankfully, she was extremely motivated, that over the course of months she went from being bedridden to walking with a cane, complete cognitive function and her occupational therapist said her arm is coming back in and making tremendous progress.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, her A-Fib came back in and caused an ischemic stroke which affected her swallowing and speech but (Thank God) didn't destroy all the progress she made, just not as strong as before.

She has since been put on blood thinners indefinitely which already scares her, but she's been extremely depressed that her progress has all been for naught. She still does the therapies but at home, there's a spark in her eyes missing. We've tried to cheer up her spirits and keep her motivated but it's coming from us, we don't really know what she's going through and there aren't many people for her to talk to (doesn't want to go to a therapist).

I understand that every stroke and outcomes are different, but I'd like to hear your success stories, what happened, where you were and where you are now (if you don't mind sharing). I'd like to tell her your stories, and maybe give her a glimmer of hope and that old spark.

Thank you in advance.

Edit: Just to note that in the last 3 weeks, she's went from a NG tube to being able to eat most foods again (tough and stringy foods are tricky) and speech is making massive improvement according to the speech therapist, but mom even dismisses that progress.",2020-08-17 23:51:47+00:00,"[""I went from being completely non communitive the first few days to almost being completely recovered.

My wife had a feeding tube in for about two weeks after her stroke. They were concerned that she was not adequately protecting her airway when she swallowed. She was very motivated to get rid of the feeding tube because she was told she wouldn‚Äôt be able to move on to skilled nursing with the feeding tube in (only true for some facilities, not all). She spent a good deal of time unconscious the first week after her stroke. She was also in neuro trauma ICU first for two days then moved to a regular hospital room for a few days. They weren‚Äôt able to control her blood pressure without heavy duty meds that required more monitoring so they moved her back to the ICU for another week. When I recall all of those hurdles and setbacks and see where she is now, I begin to see this as a success story. She will be moving to inpatient rehab later this week so I know she is progressing rapidly. The brain has an amazing ability to heal and form new pathways. It just takes time and lots of work.

Those successes led me to a position as a public affairs specialist designing and overseeing a variety of programs and community events.

It also left me unable to work at what I loved. There was no guarantee I wouldn‚Äôt have another stroke and so I was forced to give up my successful career.\n\nIt was hard, particularly in light of the fact I had few residual physical effects.

I changed from a bright, intelligent woman into someone who was easily confused and had difficulty remembering things hardly traits that could be used in any career field.

She told me that sometimes people are so determined to recover, their brain responds to the efforts they make. I‚Äôll always be grateful for her insight because it gave me hope to deal with my memory issues.\n\nAlong with the aftermath of the stroke and TIAs, I was diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) several years ago that ultimately led to early retirement. But after neurological/psych testing to measure my mild cognitive impairment earlier this year, the doctor was surprised that not only did I show no signs of MCI, but I was slightly above individuals of the same age.\n\nOver the years I have had periods of very satisfying positions, both full time and various freelance writing assignments.

My father had a massive stroke post open heart surgery July 8th. He's been in the ICU on vent since. He's showing signs of progress (Example can now open his eyes, move his limbs more, write on paper). He can't talk because he has a tracheostomy (Although we aren't certain that's the only thing stopping him from talking at this point). So far, they've not been able to ween him off the ventilator. They try for a couple hours a day but it's not making the kind of progress we'd like to see. Aside from that, he is 100% with it mentally. When we communicate he's spot on. Example I asked him if he wanted me to do anything for his anniversary with my mom, and he wrote 24 red carnations, he wrote me the exact date and year of their anniversary and even wrote a note for her to attach to the flowers I bought. He even got emotional talking about it, and teared up :-(

Now - Boredom! With all the physical issues he has, this must be on par or even worse. How do you get through the day when only 1 person can visit for 1 hr a day? For weeks he was on massive pain killers due to the open heart surgery (Heart pump replacement). He can't operate an iPad, and he has no interest in watching TV. I think his eyes are too sensitive, as he only started opening them about a week ago. I've put on podcasts for him, but the nurses rarely keep it going partly because he says to stop them.

Forgive me. Last year my best friend (22F) had a stroke because of moyamoya. No one knew she had it until it was too late. I (22F) have known her for 10 years or so, we‚Äôve been best friends since we were 12, and she‚Äôs like my family. We‚Äôve been through so much together. 

She was in really severe condition after the stroke, it looked like she was going to die, she had hemorrhaged a lot and was in a lot of pain. She had a tracheotomy and a feeding tube. All i wanted was for a miracle so my best friend would be okay. 

Months passed and she was in a rehab and then eventually got sent home when she was stable, but she‚Äôs unable to afford the physical therapy so her parents have to attempt to do what the nurses would. She‚Äôs in a wheelchair with full sensation and can move her legs a bit (right leg more than the left) but she‚Äôs weak, her left hand also has sensation but she can‚Äôt move it. I don‚Äôt mind any of the physical changes, but mentally I feel as though she‚Äôs really changed. 

She‚Äôs a lot more childish, often talks about middle school and high school more than college or any of the more recent stuff, I know she‚Äôs more forgetful and her short term memory was affected by the stroke significantly more than long term. She asks me the same questions multiple times. She‚Äôs so happy all the time, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing per say but it‚Äôs exhausting a bit. She feels more immature now, although I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs probably more mature than me after living through a near death experience.

I want to know if I‚Äôm a bad person for being frustrated. I try so hard not to be frustrated because I love her and I feel so grateful that by some miracle she‚Äôs alive after all the odds. I just get so frustrated at answering the same questions over and over, the never ending positivity and happiness, the telling me that people who don‚Äôt miss me probably miss me and that I should make an effort for them. I know that she has a new insight now but it‚Äôs so hard for me. She‚Äôs so much more childish when she talks, she doesn‚Äôt swear anymore, she doesn‚Äôt feel like an adult very much and it‚Äôs difficult sometimes. I love her so much but I feel so frustrated and sad, I feel like I don‚Äôt *really* talk to her because I don‚Äôt want to just be negative or crass or too adult the way I used to be around her. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm tired of talking about high school and middle school and my exes. 

I feel so bad for getting this way. I feel so bad when I don‚Äôt want to talk to her because I know I would‚Äôve given anything to talk to her when she was in hospital.

Does anyone else feel this way? Am I a bad person? How do I stop feeling this way? What can I do to understand better?

He is not able to move his left hand/arm, can‚Äôt really move his left leg. Even standing is still a big problem for him because his left knee would collapse if not supported when he tries to stand up.

Emotions can happen at night, but the best thing you can do for everyone is to be objective and take care of things. Help get finances in order, call his job, etc...\n\nEven the coma a stroke puts you in is major. Comas themselves take a long time to recover from. There\'s just a lot going on. You won\'t know the prognosis for a long time, and that\'s the hardest part. Every nurse and doctor I spoke to after my dad\'s said the same thing: ""we can\'t tell right now, every patient is different."" Just make sure doctors keep in touch with you; ask for the brain scans, be present.\n\nJust some background: my dad was taking care of my mom who herself had a short coma. She may have brain cancer again. I\'m now taking care of her health; she has the brain damage of an 80-year old with dementia. But then my dad had a brain stem stroke and my mom was so incapable that she left him for 9 hours before calling 911 because she didn\'t understand what happened. People don\'t normally survive brain stem strokes, and it\'s been about 3 months and 3 different hospitals. He\'s at rehab now; he can\'t swallow, can\'t walk, can\'t talk because of a tracheostomy, and I have to manage all of this. I\'m 25. It\'s a hall of mirrors. You\'re a good person, just judging by your reaching out for help. Continue on that path, keep asking for help.', ""Better-Absolutely. Even fully restored if he's lucky and its not too severe. Within a month? Highly unlikely.\n\nIt will probably affect him in some form for a long time unfortunately.\n\nGood luck to your dad, my dad had a stroke about a year ago and he's nowhere near going back to work even though he's a lot better and still keeps getting better.\n\nJust hang in there!"", 'Strokes are so different that it\'s impossible to say anything for certain. My father had one and he did actually go back to work in less than a few months and was riding his motorcycle again shortly after that. He still has bad vertigo but 2 years later you probably wouldn\'t guess that he had ever had one if you\'d met him. I would guess his experience is likely in the minority though, I\'m not sure.

644,A letter to my dad after two years,10,ecj9pb,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ecj9pb/a_letter_to_my_dad_after_two_years/,3,"2 years ago today, my dad had a stroke that changed our family forever.

December 17th was such a nice day for our whole family. We celebrated Grandma‚Äôs birthday in the company of my cousins and your siblings. We socialized, and you worked that room talking to everyone you saw. You had a blast, I could tell. It was such a great day. Everyone came. Your smile was so constant. I wish we did stuff like that more. I remember when we got home, we talked for a little bit, and I stole a few of your sweaters. They still comfort me. You hugged and kissed me goodnight, and I remember wanting to continue the conversation the next day.¬†
I can‚Äôt remember now what we were talking about, and it bothers me. When I woke up around 4am to mom saying ‚ÄúBob? Bob?‚Äù I thought you passed out or maybe you were just tired. I heard her walking around and I heard someone else walking with her. I saw flashing red lights beaming through my window, and I didn‚Äôt know how big of an impact it was about to have on me. I laid there, trying to analyze the situation; maybe I was overthinking the severity of the situation‚Ä¶ Maybe. I lay in my bed, listening.. Mom asked if you could walk. You just kept saying yes. You sounded fine. You sounded fine dad‚Ä¶ Rob helped mom get you to the ER, and I heard Hope open her door. Mom talked to her so I texted Hope and asked what was going on. You had a stroke. Mom was taking you to the ER. ***** City Hospital.. I laid in bed trying to go back to sleep, knowing that I had to get up for work, knowing Miranda was on a mattress on the floor next to me, I didn‚Äôt want to wake her up.. I didn‚Äôt go back to sleep. I laid awake, eyes wide open, staring at the dark ceiling. I watched the ambulance lights disappear, and I realized how badly I was shaking.¬†
Miranda‚Äôs alarm went off, and I told her I‚Äôd go to Jake‚Äôs surgery with her since my mom was with my dad. I filled her and Jake in on what happened, and I called into work. I was in such a spaced state that whole day. Spaced meaning that I was so out of it, I couldn‚Äôt think, and I was pushing down all of the worry so I wouldn‚Äôt cry. After Jake was stable, Miranda and I went back to my house, and I went up to my room, reading the texts my mom sent, I finally processed everything that was happening, and I lost it. I was sobbing and shaking, and Adam came to comfort me. Andrew called me and asked if I was okay, and said he‚Äôd be right over. Caleb brought a JJ‚Äôs platter home, but I didn‚Äôt feel like eating. Andrew made me eat some food and we left to see her and my dad. I brought my mom some food and when I saw my dad, my heart dropped. He was laying on the gerni in a half conscious state; he couldn‚Äôt talk, he couldn‚Äôt move, he wouldn‚Äôt eat.. His brain was fried in lamest terms. The stroke was caught too late to have used the drug that minimizes the damage. His stroke was bad. I sat there with Drew, trying to make jokes and talk to my dad. He replied with gibberish. A priest came to visit another patient, and my mom approached him. I believe it was father hood. He offered to pray over my dad, and we all said the our father. My dad said it with us. He was talking in garbles, and out came a prayer. It gave me hope that he would be okay. I waited with my mom until they were able to get my dad into a room, and then we went home while he rested.¬†
This would be the first hospital visit of many, followed by extensive visits to a rehab facility that my dad had speech, occupational, and physical therapy along with many doctors appointments. My dad had another ASD and his blood was so thick that they could barely draw it. My dad was so patient and kind throughout it, but he will never be the same ever since that night. We all took it different ways. At different times, and after 2 years, it‚Äôs not any easier. Emotionally, financially, and physically, the changes that have been made have really sucked. Trying to sell the house only added more stress. My mom is doing everything she can to be the foundation holding everything together, but my heart hurts for her loss. Everything that happened is twice as hard for her; that‚Äôs her husband.¬†
Our first Valentine‚Äôs day afterwards was tense. I remember writing my dad valentine cards, him writing them to me, and getting chocolates or going out. Hope tried to do something nice for my mom, and she had my dad sign a card for my mom from him. It was really sweet, but it made my mom upset and they got into a fight. It just made her realize that that part is gone. He has changed. He has little to no emotion, and when he does, it‚Äôs inappropriate. He just doesn‚Äôt care or doesn‚Äôt know how. He can‚Äôt hold a conversation, his memory is shot, he doesn‚Äôt want to do anything besides watch TV. He isn‚Äôt here even though he is, and that‚Äôs the hardest part. How do you grieve when he‚Äôs still here? How can I make holidays stop feeling like a nightmare?¬†
Dad, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about you. I‚Äôve keep having dreams where we are having these intellectual conversations, and they‚Äôre so bittersweet‚Ä¶ I miss you. It‚Äôs so nice to see you genuinely happy, talking to me normally, but then I wake up and remember where we‚Äôre at. I still have trouble sleeping. Everytime I hear a noise, or see a flash of light in bed, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs happening again, or something worse. December 18th, 2017. When you had your stroke, and everything changed. It‚Äôs so hard to talk about and my brain feels so scrambled. Ever since it happened, I have felt lost. My depression is worse, my anxiety is worse, and I can‚Äôt sleep. It took me a while to not feel tense or anxious when I left the house because when I did, I was worried something was going to happen. There‚Äôs so much I‚Äôll never be able to tell you and there are so many things I‚Äôll never be able to do with you. ¬†
I am so so grateful that you are still here with me, free from pain but I still feel a tremendous loss, especially when I reflect on the past. All of the memories that we made and ones that will never be. When you cry, it breaks my heart. I remember when mom told me you fell down the stairs and sobbed. She was worried you cut yourself. You‚Äôre on blood thinners so that‚Äôs not good. You seemed to be okay afterwards, but mom said you were a little bruised. How am I supposed to do this without you when all I can think about is how I want to tell you about my rises, my falls, and everything in between. I‚Äôve already lost half of you and I‚Äôm terrified that you won‚Äôt be able to walk me down the aisle. I already made a plan that Nick would walk me down, but I get choked up thinking that I actually created a backup scenario because I‚Äôm so terrified of losing you completely.¬†
You have given us such a terrific role model and I admire you for that. You have always been yourself, and you worked so hard to make sure we were happy, and that we were financially stable; working two jobs, being a nice employee to those you encountered, and spending time off of work with us. You were always super handy with cars and super helpful with fixing them. Everytime something happens to my car, I think of you and I can‚Äôt help but think about how you used to be right on telling me what was wrong and helping me. You were going to teach me a few things about cars, and now you can‚Äôt. Do you remember when you taught chemistry to homeschoolers? Do you remember helping me with my math all of the time? I remember you taking us to the ‚Äúmushroom park‚Äù all of the time but there was one time that really stood out to me. We were playing dodgeball, and I was laughing so hard because you got so into it; you were RUNNING like you meant it! Whenever we‚Äôd go to the store, you were so kind and friendly to people.¬†
You were always so polite about everything, and I know that I got that from you (mom too but I just remember you always using your manners). Your realness when you weren‚Äôt afraid to show emotion, like when you cried on Memorial day(Also my birthday) of 2010 when we visited your father‚Äôs grave. Hope laughed which made you laugh, and we all laughed. You are like Hope; when you laugh, tears come down your face. I always loved when you laughed so hard it made tears come down your cheeks. You were always really thoughtful and caring when you had a holiday with mom whether it be Christmas, birthday, anniversary, or valentine‚Äôs day. No matter how much mom hated Valentine‚Äôs day, you would always get her something super thoughtful. A card, flowers, chocolates, and then you‚Äôd take her out.¬†
I remember one year for mother‚Äôs day, you tried to make her breakfast. The eggs and bacon turned out okay, but the french toast‚Ä¶ You tried your best. Mom came down and fixed the stuff up and made dinner. I will never forget that. I thought it was so sweet that you did that. You were never a good cook, but you could grill but you tried to make them anyways, and that really got me. One year for father‚Äôs day, we went to play baseball, and you collided with Hill and you both ended up bruised from the collision, but we all laughed so hard. You were firm in your beliefs, but you were a big softie. I remember when we went on our family trip over the summer of 2017, and you were so high spirited. That was so fun. I miss you and all of these memories you gave me, and I miss you squeezing my hand too long and too tight in church after saying the our father. I miss you goofing around with Hope and I at the table. Do you remember this stuff? I‚Äôd ask but I don‚Äôt want you to get emotional. I just want to know how you think now. Do you still get frustrated? Are you proud of me? Do you miss being able to do more?

I love you dad. I miss you so much. I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds selfish. I just can‚Äôt get you out of my head, not even after 2 years.",2019-12-18 21:53:12+00:00,"['""He was talking in garbles, and out came a prayer.""\nThank you for sharing and I\'m sure he is proud of you.', ""I'm so sorry.

645,Stroke at 28 Years Old - New World,9,drromh,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/drromh/stroke_at_28_years_old_new_world/,23,"Last Wednesday, I had a (first?) stroke at 28 years old. I immediately lost a lot of vision (right field) and severe aphasia before subsequently got a pretty bad headache. I was very lucky and was able to get to get the blood thinner an hour and a half after the stroke's start. MRI showed my left parieto-temporal lobe looked like it was lit up like a Christmas tree. I got real lucky though, since I went from pre-TPA almost entirely aphasic to be able to largely function verbal today.

Factors:

* No family history
* Great blood pressure
* Decent cholesterol (ok LDL, awesome HDL)
* Started having what looked to be painless ocular migraines (like milder as what the stroke eventually manifested) after a few years ago. Used to be a few years between, then more frequently.
* They thought I **might** have PFO, as hinted by the ultrasound

Now...I really don't know what comes next. Cardiologist and neurologist don't know what happened and I keep having 'stuff'. Yesterday I had the 'ocular migraine' paired with a new headache, the ED thought it ended up as a TIA. Today starting about two hours ago, my right eye's top eyelid was either swollen or lax (felt very heavy). It's feeling a little better, not sure if it's because I took about 1000mg of aspirin as soon as I noticed it was there. When I try to look all the way upward, definitely off.

To be totally honest, I kinda feel like I'm just one foot out the door, but I'm just happy being able to enjoy some (maybe last) days with my fiancee.

I know it's a lot, but does anybody out there have thoughts? Would appreciate any musing or suggestions at all.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Not sure if related, but I developed unilateral tinnitus about five years ago. No identification of cause, has steadily worsen over time a bit, and tinnitus is on the side of stroke (left).  Dunno if it matters?

Also, I just saw a large explained bruise on my wrist...guessing I'm gonna dial back to 325mg aspirin instead of being at 1000mg for each of the past two days.

It's a heavy situation but here's what happened the night of:

Dad (69, very healthy hippie nutritionist) started speaking gibberish to my mom, she thought he was tired and told him to sit down on the couch. He did, and then promptly sank down onto the floor. Mom still thought he was just sleeping and gave him blankets and pillows. That was 11pm. She checked him throughout the night but then at around 8, she tried to wake him up, noticed he wasn't waking, and had peed himself. Then she called TWO of his friends who urged her to call 911, so she finally did and he went into the hospital around 9:15. This was last Friday/Saturday, so it's been just over a week.

Because he wasn't exhibiting the regular stroke symptoms, they said they didn't really know what was going on, until the next day after the CTscans. It was caused by A fibrillation, which means his heart wasn't beating right and blood was pooling and clotting, and when his heart finally made a proper contraction, it sent a clot to his brain stem.

Right now, dad is in ICU still in critical condition. His blood pressure randomly rises. He's intubated and sedated most of the time. He moves his limbs and it looks like he's wincing and crying sometimes. He can't swallow, he can breathe over the machine, but they need to keep his airway clean because he can't control his secretions. He had been able to open one eye or raise his eyebrows but now he can't. 

The doctor yesterday said that it's been a week, and this is what the damage is, like the clot is gone, the swelling wasn't really an issue. My dad's consciousness is what it is, and he is not alert/awake enough. Doctor said they think it's time for a tracheostomy because my dad will be like this for a while. Still no prognosis, still day-to-day. 

&#x200B;

He'll respond to us in some ways I think. I asked that if he could hear us to uncross his legs, and he did. I hate to think he's trapped. Beyond all of this, my mom is severely neurologically impaired after 3 brain tumors and she herself  came out of a random coma a few months ago and she's recovering from that. She relied on my dad, they live on a farm, we just found out their place is in foreclosure. My dad does not have life insurance, no living will, no nothing that could help anybody out.

&#x200B;

I just want to know if my dad's condition sounds like anyone else. The stroke was in the brainstem and hypothalamus. Can it get worse than it is at this point? Is there going to be a point that he won't be critical? Some kind of sign pointing that way? I wish there were statistics on this kind of thing. Is all this considered life support? help :(",2019-09-29 13:53:11+00:00,"['I was in a car accident on August 2008.   I started acting strange.  A lot strangers that I had been.

652,My 42 year old Dad had a stroke yesterday.....,10,coezwm,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/coezwm/my_42_year_old_dad_had_a_stroke_yesterday/,6,"So I guess I'm just looking for some real life experiences from some of you people. My dad suffered a Hemorrhagic stroke in the region of the brain that controls vision. They say the bleeding has stopped they're just waiting for the blood to be absorbed so it's not causing pressure on that region of the brain or something like that. they say until that happens they can't diagnose what the long-term effects are going to be if any.

He lost some strength in the left side of his body but has sense regained most of it within the first 12 hours, but his vision is blurry and he's seeing double still, and still has a very bad headache. The main thing I'm wondering is for those who's experienced a stroke like this where you had blurry vision did it go away completely or are you still living with it or does it improve over time? 

I don't know what to do in this situation my dad is a healthy guy and is a full time diesel mechanic along with running our family farm. I'm scared he won't be able to go back to work because of his vision and I know that will mentally crush him. Not to mention I'm sure we owe $250k easily on the farm and assets, The nurse mentioned something about the vision might not go back to normal and I could see the panic rush over my dad's face. This is terrifying for me because I know how much his independence means to him and it kills me seeing him like this.",2019-08-10 07:21:15+00:00,"["">The main thing I'm wondering is for those who's experienced a stroke like this where you had blurry vision did it go away completely or are you still living with it or does it improve over time?\n\nIf you look at what we have said to many people on this group you will see that we have one thing we say to almost everyone: every stroke is different. My experience with my stroke is pretty meaningless to your dad and his. We can say that some things are normal, but just because we haven't experienced them doesn't mean they're not.\n\nYou're saying the medical people are saying that they don't know what the long term will be because they're waiting for the blood pressure to go down. Okay. So they don't know yet, and neither do we. All I can say is, if he had the stroke *yesterday*, any improvement *at all* that he has had so far is *very* good. Heck, I wasn't even conscious for a whole week, didn't start to show any real recovery for about a month and a half, and I was sleepy all the time for about a year. He's aware, his eyes are open, he's communicating semi coherently, and he understands some of what is being said to him, after only one day? Jump for joy and sing hallelujah. He's ahead of 99% of the pack already.\n\n(Incidentally I was 43 when I had my stroke.)\n\n>I'm scared he won't be able to go back to work because of his vision and I know that will mentally crush him.\n\nWhile I understand being scared, as it's a scary situation for all involved, it's much too early to have any clue what will happen in the long run.\n\n>Not to mention I'm sure we owe $250k easily on the farm and assets,\n\nAs the family, the question I'd be looking at is what insurance do you have for him (I have insurance that paid basically my full salary, plus medical insurance, so in the end I didn't have anything to worry about), and failing that, who can you get (hire?) to do the work in his place, and how will the family afford that? I'd start looking at this question very quickly, as he'll need time to recover in even the best case, so it'd be good if the work is taken care of for him for now.\n\n>The nurse mentioned something about the vision might not go back to normal and I could see the panic rush over my dad's face.\n\nIt's very bad for a medical professional to scare him in that manner, and as a recent stroke victim, he really needs not to be scared just now, and as I said above, it's much too soon to know and he needs to be able to focus on rest and recovery, not worrying about the farm.

She actually is starting her rehab today and is very much looking forwards to real cloths and a shower!\n\nMy advice is to not put the cart before the horse. Every patient is different, every person hits different milestones at different times. The only thing you can do is keep your dad comfortable and think about where you think is the best place for him to do rehab once he\'s ready. \n\nIf you absolutely must do something to help now, you can ask his physical therapists about things you can do with him in his spare time, or advocate for him with his care team. His future might look dark and scary right now, but the only way to know what lies ahead is to keep moving forward.', ""It took me 6 months for my vision to improve. I couldn't read following my stroke, and I cant drive again, *ever*.\n\nThe eye doctor and later the  OT both agreed that its not something thats likely to improve beyond what it has.\n\nThe good news is driving aside it impacts me very little day to day.\n\nYeah, I dont really have independence anymore. It is what it is."", 'Hemorrhagic strokes are worse because blood is extremely toxic to brain tissue, and blood leaks onto the brain in hemorrhagic strokes. This is why a small hemorrhagic stroke has worse outcomes than even a much larger ischemic stroke by area.\n\nPosterior circulation strokes tend to be the strokes that affect vision (which is about 20% of the strokes in the Western world -- in the East, it\'s much higher). \n\nVision problems don\'t only occur with damage to the occipital lobe, either. The LGN area of the thalamus; optic radiations; even the parietal part of the brain affects vision (facial blindness comes from parietal damage). It\'s collectively called ""central vision"" to distinguish it from the eye (orbit) itself, too.\n\nThe blurriness (Diplopia) -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia) \\-- is binocular in stroke. Close one eye and the blurriness is still seen per eye, unlike in non stroke misalignment of the eyes will do (no blurriness with one eye closed). This can be combined also with ptsosis (drooping eyelid\\[s\\]) --  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis\\_(eyelid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)) \\-- and it\'s degrees of severity. Diplopia and ptsosis in stroke are caused by cranial nerve damage, mainly with the CN3 nerve that runs right smack in the mid-brain, but can also affects the CN4 and CN7 nerves, too.\n\nThat blurriness looks like trying to see from underwater (or if you had ointment in your eyes before). Sometimes letters and objects are clear and not blurry, but there\'s noticeable ghosting, which is the frustrating part (edges of objects will have a white or grey halo around them). To me it looks just like in 2:03 in this video...\n\n[https://youtu.be/joQedu6zGaA?t=123](https://youtu.be/joQedu6zGaA?t=123)\n\nI\'m ataxic now from the stroke and it becomes a serious problem as I can misjudge the position of steps, why I walk with a cane as a ""feeler"" to judge where the real edge begins and ends.\n\nWhen I was in the hospital about 5 days after the stroke, I woke to a very scary event and thought I was going blind: Seen the cover of Pink Floyd\'s album cover for the ""Darkside of the Moon"" album? That prism separating white light to the light spectrum colors? That\'s what I saw at about 90% opaqueness. It covered most of my left eye and the top part of my right eye, and it was mostly blue in color (80% of it). When they scheduled me for a MRI 2 days later, the MRI scattered that light into atoms, too! Little dots of color being atomized. That spectrum thing didn\'t go away until a full week after I was discharged, and left a paracentral scotoma --  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma) \\-- ""scar"" in the upper left corner of my vision. It\'s a grayish floater like scar that\'s seen against light backgrounds.\n\nBUT, with strokes two people could have the exact same type of stroke and have totally opposite outcomes, as our bodies are anatomically different (and our personalities). The P2 artery that causes so much mischief in PCA strokes? Some people are born with one extension to feed the thalamus with blood, instead of two. That\'s a difference of reduced blood flow or total loss of blood flow to the area, with worse outcomes. All because of being born with a different shaped blood vessel. That offers hope though when you may get dismal news. There\'s a chance, despite the grim diagnosis, that improvement can occur, as we are different. Outcomes are according to the survivor, not according to region.\n\nI also find that some of ""info"" online are factually wrong, too (especially the difference between ipslateral and contralateral in describing which side of the body XYZ stroke will affect (and that\'s due to the dominance of MCA strokes and how blinding they are to clinicians to SEE as a stroke, too). Some strokes will have the affected side be on the opposite side of the body \\[contralateral\\]; other strokes it will be the same side \\[ipslateral\\]). My stroke was right hemisphere, but my weak side is on the left. So you also have to double check what is on these websites as ""facts"". Even the most credited sites do get that wrong. Some like Wikipedia got the blood flow to the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule wrong (and I protested it), because that division of the internal capsule has blood supplies from BOTH MCA and PCA arteries. My strokes were completely PCA and Basilar, as the MCA DO NOT supply the blood for the posterior circulation. My strokes affected PLOIC/Thalamus/Medial Temporal/Medial Parietal  and nicked the Occipital. It was a clear PCA stroke. And a number of neurologists told me so.\n\nDouble and cross check info, and if in doubt, talk with the neurologist(s).']",653

Forty-three days is not a lot in the course of a lifetime, but as our family lived the nightmare, each day following Kari‚Äôs stroke moved in slow motion. Waiting prompted fear. The unknown paralyzed emotions. When our 33-year-old daughter experienced a traumatic brain injury, a stroke, logic no longer existed.
The radiologist, Dr. Peal, entered the room to discuss test results; the medical explanations sounded like lines from the poem, Jaberwocky ¬†by Lewis Carroll .¬†
‚ÄòTwas brillig, and the slithy toves¬†Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe.At that moment, he made about as much sense as those lines. I stared wondering which questions to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is a . . .? ¬†Why did . . ? How can . . ? ? ? ? ? ""¬†¬†Dr. Peal's compassion provided wisdom more valuable than the diagnosis. He encouraged us not to expect quick results because overcoming a stroke takes months ‚Äì years.¬† Let the hospital staff do their job and do not hurry the process.¬†
‚ÄúIt is a long journey. Think of it as a marathon, not a sprint. Take care of yourself.‚Äù
We had been in the hospital so many hours, time held no value. The first day, my husband and I never even thought about eating; our needs became secondary. Eventually, with coercion, we ventured to the cafeteria, attempted to eat a bowl of tomato soup, but when we discovered it was squash, we left it on the table with our appetites. Yes, labels probably provided that information. Reading would have required a higher level of consciousness. I am not sure we would have eaten much if it was tomato.When my sister-in-law arrived, she ordered us home to sleep with strict instruction.
""Take are of yourselves.""We went home and with the assistance of two over the counter sleeping pills, I slept. My husband‚Äôs body absorbed the rest as if coma induced. In a conversation driving back to the hospital the next morning, I commented on my exhaustion during the ride home the previous night.¬† Randy pointed out I had driven my own car. OMG! I realized concerned, I possessed no memory of driving home ‚Äì no recollection at all.¬†Our youngest daughter, Kat, called often to check on the situation but I think she was mostly checking on her dad and me.¬†
‚ÄúWhat have you eaten? Did you sleep? Are you taking care of yourself?‚Äù¬†My immediate response, ‚ÄúYes, don‚Äôt worry about us.‚Äù
Even the social worker asked the dreaded question.
‚ÄúAre you taking care of yourself?‚ÄùI wanted to scream, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about me. My daughter is laying in a bed. She can‚Äôt talk or move her right side. I must take care of her. I can‚Äôt even begin to take care of myself.‚ÄùInstead I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù
No until I sat and talked with my granddaughter, Kari‚Äôs oldest child, and her other grandmother that the situation turned surreal. In front of my granddaughter, Grandma Virnene asked, ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚ÄùThere was THAT question, again! I stiffly replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine - just fine.‚ÄùTo change the focus I asked Jodi, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù
This mature 12-year-old responded like a parrot, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine - just fine.‚Äù Her four simple words slapped me in the face. She lied.
We were all emotionally broken. At that moment I confessed and explained how I really felt. I looked her in the eye.‚ÄúOK. I will tell the truth. I am not fine! This situation sucks and maybe we should all be honest and share our pain.‚Äù
By modeling strength, persistence and optimism without sharing my pain, I stifled emotions, thereby; Jodi learned to do the same. Experience taught that emotions bottled too long exploded. By ignoring grief, it grew stronger. To conquer and control the suffering, we had to acknowledge it, support each other, and stand strong.
Dialogue flowed easier ‚Äì healthier.¬† I feared sharing my pain would expose my wounds, force me to lose control but in fact, sharing allowed me to garnish comfort and in return offer comfort. I felt less alone.
The next day improved because I started setting limits. I learned to limit my worry so it didn‚Äôt eat away at me; my strategy was to give it to the Lord. Once I admitted I have no control in the outcome and surrendered it, breathing became natural.
Everyone around me found a strategy to confront worry. Jim, Kari‚Äôs father-in-law, wrote positive affirmations, posted them in the hospital room, and read them aloud. My husband used humor and made work an outlet.¬† Friends and family prayed, scheduled counseling appointments, and volunteered to help.¬† Different approaches provided relief to the grief.
I learned the first lesson:¬† When staring at what seems like an insurmountable challenge, take care of yourself.If an athlete trains for a marathon, she consumes a balanced diet, stretches to warm-up muscles, practices daily, gets in shape. When a student prepares for an exam, they study, get a good night‚Äôs sleep, and eat a healthy breakfast before beginning the test.
Before¬†Neil Armstrong¬†traveled into space, before he walked on the moon, he¬†followed a strict regimen including survival training, physical endurance, and mental acuity. ¬†When Commander Armstrong‚Äôs rocket launched into outer space, his life resided in the hands of many competent specialist at NASA. He trusted others to bring him home.
When I entered the hospital, raced to Kari‚Äôs bedside, watched her labored breathing, and looked into her frightened eyes, my first impulse pushed me to take control only to realize that the situation was uncontrollable. I surrendered to the professionals with the knowledge and skills to improve her health. I trusted them to send her home. Only then did I begin to understand the prescription, ‚ÄúTake care of yourself.‚Äù¬†Everyone believed their actions served the best interests of the patient.During our time at the hospital, I witnessed patients‚Äô loved ones demand results, argue decisions, defy instructions, and question authority. I watched the hospital staff strive to make patients comfortable, comply with directions, simply put - get the job done.¬†
A Kari‚Äôs mother and a team member, I accepted responsibilities: love her, provide hope, watch for human errors, offer supportive reminders, encourage, and be available when others were not. Slowly and with some resistance, I relinquished power knowing I faced failure if I didn‚Äôt take care of myself.As my body tired, my faith wavered, and my spirit plummeted, I received the message.
‚ÄúTake care of yourself.‚ÄùThe lesson for everyone sitting beside a loved one‚Äôs bed or agonizing in a waiting room is to find a release: work, tell a joke, play a game, pray, write positive affirmations, seek counseling, whatever it might be, whatever provides comfort.Though I am not a person who asks for help, I discovered the value in accepting help. When I was incapable of taking care of myself, others stepped up to take care of me.
Support came in the form of a friend who held my hand when fuzzy brain matter made paperwork impossible. It came in the body of my sister-in-law who provided relief at a moment‚Äôs notice or without being asked. People provided food (some strangers to me), financial support, and positive energy. People bestowed overwhelming love simply because they cared. They didn‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù They simply checked on us and completed tasks that had to be accomplished.
When I said, ‚ÄúI am fine,‚Äù they heard my words but understood what I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äì didn‚Äôt admit.¬† They took care of me when I couldn‚Äôt.¬†",2019-05-09 16:06:43+00:00,[],658

So I ate some of the gummie bears since they were right next to me thinking the sugar would wake me up and decided to shower so I can really try to sleep. 

I remember feeling this weird zap in my head that made me stop eating the candy like maybe that was too much sugar and I stood up to head to the bathroom and my movement was uncoordinated, I bumped into some shoeboxes and I was SO confused by that, I don't just knock into things. So I got on my knee and picked up what fell and when I tried to get up... I kept coming down to my knee. I was still stuck on how I knocked my stuff over to really clue in that I wasn't standing and that was my objective. So I tried to stand and my left side was weak and numb, and I kept falling down and I couldn't even get to my knee. I was so confused by this. So i thought okay, I'm laying on my floor now, I'm really tired, maybe just rest and I'll be good. But I felt like I wouldn't be able to wake up on my own if i did that (As in, i'm a light sleeper and can rest for 20mins if I only want to nap a short while instead of oversleeping and i felt like i would oversleep). So I worked really hard to get my phone off my desk and to pull my gym bag attached to my doorknob to open my room door.

I got my phone, I contacted my mom saying I didn't feel well, and she told me to call 911. I did that, gave them my info. I was conscious, speech was fine, reasoning capabilities also fine. It was just the left side weakness and numbness that I noticed. I made it downstairs and on my porch when the ambulance arrived.

Took me to the hospital and they told me I had an acute ischemic stroke. Then the weakness and numbness occurred AGAIN and it was difficult lifting my arm it felt so heavy and this time the left side of my cheek felt numb... so they gave me a tpa and my symptoms resolved itself eventually. Then I was transferred to another hospital with a neuro stroke team. 

I had CT/MRI/bubble test done and what was found is that I may have had a blood clot in my neck that resulted in the clot they found in my brain that led to my stroke. They don't know the cause.... I'm still waiting on results from some bloodwork that may take a week or so. I know I don't have that heart condition PFO. (Also, I'm not overweight, don't smoke, don't take drugs, I barely drink since I don't go out much so why bother)They also performed an ultrasound on my right leg and neck that I complained felt somewhat uncomfortable (my neck kinda hurt bit stiff and my leg just felt not like it had a cramp but like it needed to stretch) that came back negative.... I am curious though if an ultrasound would find evidence of a dvt from 2 months prior? Or if a dvt could last a day or two and feel better when you walk on it and stretch it out?

And I'm also wondering if what if that zap I thought I felt after eating the candy was really a seizure or something? No one mentioned seeing a seizure on the scans but maybe that's something you have to specifically be looking for? And I didn't mention the candy thing bc tbh I was in shock about the whole ""youre 26 and you just had a stroke"" thing. I'm still not over it.

I took a trip with my friend to asia in November and on the flight back I remember my right leg (calf and thigh) hurt, I wore snug leggings that I think were like compression leggings and I moved around on the plane and I hydrated because I didn't want a clot they say that can happen on long flights. it was a 16 hour flight and my leg hurt for probably half of it. I had minor relief after my leg got used to moving around but once I was able to get off the plane and have REAL movement the pain lessoned.  I don't remember having pain the next day though. If I did I would have def had it checked out. I also was experiencing tendonitis and that REALLY hurt on the flight but I made it through. So... I'm not sure if what happened was dvt??? Wouldn't it have hurt more and longer than a day? That was 2 months ago..... what if I had a blood clot from the flight and then it led to my stroke 2 months later... can that happen? Idk... the thought really scares me though because... I felt fine and what my body was this ticking time bomb. I started taking birth control again after that trip, but my doctors told me to stop taking it since those can have a side effect of strokes. I also have crohn's disease and high cholestrol. I'm on blood thinners and lipator, baby aspirin and humira for my crohns. 

I've had that light headache since hours before the stroke and have been taking Tylenol. The last two days I didn't take Tylenol and this morning I woke up with it hurting more than it has, and I had pain behind my eye and after i googled it the term ""brain aneurism"" came up so I started worrying about that... and I feel like... if I can have a stroke then anything is on the table. 

Doctors said I don't seem to have any deficits and besides the headaches and the occasional weird pains I'm feeling in my leg/neck/chest I feel alright. My energy is still a bit low but that will resolve itself. They said I don't have any restrictions and can go back to my normal routine and that its safe for me to fly. However I do not feel that way... I mean I'm on blood thinners now, I've found 2 bruises on me already and I'm supposed to fly to london in april with my friend I've never been and I was really excited but... I don't know if it's a good idea. Still time to figure that out though. 

&#x200B;

I had a stroke. I was VERY lucky. Not lucky enough not to have one, but lucky in so many ways considering the situation. I haven't cried about it since the first day, but I think I could have maybe died idk no one SAID that... they didn't say a lot of things... but I was in shock when they were talking to me so who knows. And I'm too scared to ask my mom who was there.... I know the whole thing really shook her up. I don't feel like living my life differently.... I still want to find a good job in my field, find a boyfriend, I don't know if I want to take trips anymore...

I had a stroke in 2016, during a period when I was very sick, probably in my sleep because I don\'t remember it happening. I felt I\'d taken a turn for the worse, was having trouble walking, trouble with coordination, extreme fatigue, extreme sensitivity to light and sound, severe brain fog and trouble with speaking. I went to the doctor and saw one of my primary care provider\'s physician assistants. She dismissed my symptoms as medication side effects and sent me home with orders to stop the medication immediately. A few days later I had an episode that my husband thought was a seizure. He took me to the ER. It wasn\'t a seizure, it was a series of strong myoclonic jerks, a common withdrawal symptom of stopping that medication abruptly without tapering off. But while I was at the ER, the doctor who examined me noticed my other symptoms, thought there could be something neurologic going on, had a cat scan done, saw something abnormal, and transferred me to a large hospital where I was diagnosed as having had a stroke. They couldn\'t tell from the MRI exactly when it happened. The assumption was when the symptoms started. I had all kinds of tests ran, no cause was ever determined. I ended up having a TIA a year later. All the tests were repeated and new ones ran. Still, no cause was determined. However, after that I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, Sjogren\'s syndrome. I was referred to a neurologist who went through my medical records bery carefully and saw that I had my yearly physicals right before both the stroke and TIA, and both times, my inflammation levels were extremely high, and I had reported symptoms that were consistent with strong autoimmune flare ups. At the time, whichever of my primary care provider\'s physician assistants I had seen those days dismissed it as stress and poor lifestyle habit related. It wasn\'t until I demanded more tests be ran that additional results pointing towards autoimmune issues were found and I was referred to a rheumatologist.  The neurologist believes that the stroke and TIA were most likely both caused by the undiagnosed and untreated autoimmune disease. Sjogren\'s is linked to strokes. As of now, it\'s the only explanation that makes any sense. I only have minor physical deficits, mostly weakness in my left leg. But I have more significant mental and sensory deficits. Aphasia, trouble speaking. I get overwhelmed easily by stimuli. Sound, color, smell, taste, feel. If too many things are going on around me at once I kind of short circuit and freeze up. I have a very hard time with executive function, so making efficient use of my time and being productive is a challenge. I was a housewife when I had the stroke, so no occupational therapy was offered. And since I can walk short distances just fine and use my hands well, no physical therapy was offered either. My neurologist says that this far out, my deficits are pretty much set. And my goal is to learn ways to work around them. Based on the size and location of ""dead space"" in my brain left by the stroke, my deficits should be much, much worse. Doctors have all told me to consider myself very fortunate, focus on maintaining overall health and wellness, stay on top of the autoimmune disease, take aspirin and Plavix, and do my best to have a fulfilling life. \n ']",662

663,UPDATE: Mother had a stroke,9,7rfmnz,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/7rfmnz/update_mother_had_a_stroke/,11,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/7o6zjk/mother_had_a_stroke/

I just wanted to post a quick update for anyone interested.  Recap: My mother had a stroke on 1/2/18, she was taken to the hospital and they didn't see the stroke in the CT scan.  As a result she woke up the next day in the hospital with right side paralysis and the stroke was not discovered until they did a MRI with contrast.  

Since her release from the hospital she's been transferred to quite a fantastic rehab center where she is getting 3 hours of physical, occupational and speech therapy per day.  When she originally had the stroke she had the following symptoms:

* Right side paralysis (she struggled to use her right arm at all and walking was not possible)
* Severely slurred speech, particularly if she was tired it was very difficult to understand her
* High levels of fatigue where she needed to sleep for long periods after short PT sessions

Well I'd just like to tell anyone who recently suffered a stroke, hope is definitely not foolish.  After 7 days of physical therapy my mom has recovered use of her right arm sufficiently that she is using it to lift small bean bags in therapy, open envelopes, lift her arm nearly above her head, and she can touch each finger to her thumb individually as well as open and close her hand.  They have her walking up and down stairs, she was walking without a walker earlier today using only a cane, and the slur in her speech is nearly completely gone.

Her PT's have old us that her recovery is nothing short of remarkable, she is making progress so fast that they anticipate she might be able to be released back to live at home around the 30th and they've told her there is a good possibility that if she can't recover full arm function, she can certainly get back to 75-90%, which she is very happy with.  

I don't want to give anyone false hope, but please remember to wait and see when your loved one has a stroke.  When my mother had a stroke I was convinced that she would be in a wheelchair and without use of her right arm for the rest of her life, and looking at the progress she's made in such a short time is amazing.  To anyone who has suffered a stroke, please, take your PT seriously and practice religiously!  Thanks everyone for your feedback, I'll give you guys another update hopefully after she is discharged.

Long term memory was 80% gone and was slowly coming back.  But each month a little less came back.

I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu.  I can whip up fantastic dishes whithout thought.  But I can't follow six lines in a cookbook.

I have a Doctorate in comparative religion from Northwestern University.   I can't remember any of the texts I read.  If I read them again it's like the first time.  But I know the information.

I only remember going out with my grandfather shooting once.  But when I took his pistol to the shooting range I could do a smiley face on the target from 25 yards away.  When I got home I stripped it down, cleaned it and reassembled it without thought.

I watch Big Bang Theory or Star Trek and it's like I'm seeing it for the very first time.  Or I read books that are dog eared from my library and it's like I'm reading it for the first time.

I remember dating women, but I can't tell you about individual dates.

I can tell if someone is lying from which way they look, how they stand, pupil dilation a hundred details.  But I don't know how I know this.

I see 3-5 doctors a week about the stroke.  Yesterday I went to a Behavior rehab doctor.  He suggested that I sign a power of attorney to someone else because I may not make rash judgements.  He was basically saying I was mentally incompetent.

He currently is part of an intensive outpatient rehab program where he does 5 hours of therapy a day, 3 times a week. From an energy perspective, he's got plenty! And he's also able to walk with a cane (with lingering balance issues), has a great appetite, and overall more focused/attentive. I've been really excited and grateful for his progress and about 1.5 weeks ago, his speech/swallow therapist even said we could take him off soft foods and mildly thick liquids and he could resume a normal diet. 

However the past few days, a couple things have made me a little nervous. While at rehab, he didn't realize he needed to use the restroom in time and had an accident, which has never happened before. On the same day, his therapists felt he was more confused than normal because he washed his hands in the water fountain instead of the sink. (We did a urine test and ruled out UTI already and when I asked if this could be due to recent change in medication, PCP said unlikely and feels it's just his recovery process post-stroke.) But on top of that, his speech/swallow therapist said his swallow has worsened and asked us to put him back on soft foods and mildly thick liquids. I asked her if it's a cause for concern but she said it could just be that he's eating too quickly still or allergies due to change in season.

674,Advice on Helping My Dad Through Recovery,10,pkf30o,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/pkf30o/advice_on_helping_my_dad_through_recovery/,5,"Hi all,

First, I want to thank you all for sharing your stories. It's been nice to learn about other people's experiences while trying to support my dad through his.

&#x200B;

My dad (53M) had a moderately large stroke on Aug 17th caused by a blood clot. He spent a week in the hospital and then a week and a half in a rehab facility for ST/OT/PT. He is now quarantining with his girlfriend due to a covid exposure, and then will be staying with my older sister and her family for at least a month. Before his stroke, he was a super independent guy. He owns his house and has a large garden and a cat. He would always be in the yard working on a tractor or car.  He would work a manual labor job during the week and spend most weekends with his girlfriend. His stroke has left him with limited movement in his right (dominant) arm and hand and aphasia/dysarthria/dysphagia. Due to this, he can't live alone just yet or drive (they took his license).

&#x200B;

Since he has been out of rehab it seems his mental health has declined. They did start him on an SSRI in the hospital. I imagine he's feeling what I see a lot on this thread. Thinking you just have to get through rehab and then you'll have your life back when in reality there's still so much work you have to do and still so many limitations. I'd love advice on how to best support my dad through his recovery, but especially in these two areas:

&#x200B;

1. Encouragement without infantilization

This is something we, his family, have really struggled with. I want to tell him good job constructing that sentence/expressing that thought, but I sound like I'm praising a two-year-old. I'm worried that the way we have been encouraging him might be making him feel small.

&#x200B;

2) How to give him back some independence while he has to be monitored

Since he is living with others for at least a month, I'd like to find ways he can remain independent. His caseworker suggested letting him cook some of his meals and he can already shower himself with a bath transfer chair. What else can we have him do? 2/3 of his children live 1+ hours away, but we are willing to come back on the weekends and stay with him at his own house. That way he can take care of the cat, tend to the garden, and do other things like that.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this post! I'm open to any advice you have to share.",2021-09-08 17:29:08+00:00,"['1) Always celebrate the small improvements. If he couldn\'t speak more than a couple words last week, but can make a full sentence this week, celebrate. If he has slightly improved stamina compared to 2 weeks ago, celebrate. When he\'s getting down, look at him and let him know how proud you are of him and how strong he\'s fighting this.\n\n2) Socialization is helpful. It\'s hard to provide for independence when that usually consists of some level of hazard if not supervised. This may be one of those things where someone has him in the corner of their eye, but unless he\'s about to get hurt, let him struggle through the difficulty as part of the learning process.\n\nThat\'s what stroke ""recovery"" is, a learning process. I hate using the term recovery even though I catch myself at times saying it out of habit. It\'s more about learning your new life. Until there is a level of acceptance that this is how things will be, it will be rough. I\'m not saying to be defeatist about it because there will be continued opportunity for improvement over the first 6-12 months, but overall, its about coming to grips that life will not be returning to the pre-stroke state, and that we (as patients, caregivers, and professionals) need to learn how to change our reaction to the stroke since our anger over it happening will do no good in the long-term. Frustration and anger as we adjust is ok. Persistently dwelling on nothing other than how life used to be is not.\n\nThe depression tends to be temporary in many cases, and often dependent on the level and speed at which one can come to grips with this new reality. Meds and talk therapy do wonders, but often times, I see my patients overcome their depressive symptoms with time when there\'s a strong support group around. \n\nStay strong!', 'I would recommend that he take a phone with him everywhere, esp. if he plans to go outside in the garden.

I have been reading through the threads and a lot of the recovery stories make me even more hopeful for my mom. She's 61, had a knee surgery, but developed clots over a couple of days which led to heart attack and a stroke. She was revived from the heart attack but was out for the shortest while which led to anoxic brain damage. This happened on Father's Day of this year.

Mom went from ER, ICU, later to a stroke unit at the hospital where she was taken off a ventilator as she could breathe on her own. Her speech is very forced and rough but she indicated she can barely see. She never had cognitive issues before and I can't blame her at all for getting the years mixed up but she can always tell who is in the room by their voice and says hello to them. She cannot move from her bed but can sometimes move her fingers a little bit. So mom was doing pretty okay and stuff and she was later then transferred to a rehab facility except things get scarier. Mom developed pneumonia due to something else and is rushed back to the hospital, stayed at the hospital for another few weeks and then returns to the said rehab facility.

Here she is still in a lot of pain and normally there are 2 patients in a room, but her discomfort is so intense that she is unfortunately crying out a lot and her neighboring patient is always transferred because of the noise. It's fine for us as the family since there's more room for us and the privacy is fine but she's had about 3 neighboring patients who complained about her crying. We are sadly advised today after about 20 or so consecutive days at the rehab facility that she is no longer considered 'improving' and that her insurance will no longer cover her stay. Turns out she's actually been admitted to a short term care facility. We are making an appeal, and that's a whole topic in itself, but if anyone else has dealt with shitty insurance stuff related to strokes I'd love to  hear what happened though I hope it was resolved.

All of this being said, I'm trying to work with my mom's hands and arms. She said she likes having her hands and fingers rubbed and as we exercise them more I notice that the spasms seem to be less intense. They seem to occur about once every few minutes and it sadly lasts all day when she's not totally sedated. She is currently receiving physical therapy which involves splints, boots, and muscle stretching. I've seen her rest for about an hour with no spasms but then they'll flare up, wake her up, and we try to comfort her through the pain.

If anyone has ever dealt with this before I'd love to hear EVERYTHING. I read these posts all of the time and I keep them in mind. My mom in the last month understands that she had a stroke and likes to be talked to so I'd love to be able to either read responses to her about similar experiences or anything really.

i used to chain smoke as a teenager all the way up until i was in my late twenties, my diet was shit ( but for the past few years that has improved significantly despite my recent lapse into comfort food because of the one month i wasn't able to get my antidepressants ). i've always been physically active in one way or another so i've never been overweight by much considering my body type ( tall, always typically lean, my highest weight was 220 lbs but i've came down to 170 since then and have really toned up ). but i don't think that it's a habit induced issue as much as it is one that's genetic - i dropped and went unconscious once when i was 13 and had to go to the hospital; people who have had TIA have told me that it sounds a lot like a mini episode. i laughed it off at first, but now...well. that's what i get i guess lol

anyway i've been down visiting family, we went and had dinner, i had two double green tea shots, we went home and called it a night. i woke up around 4 in the morning to the shadows on the ceiling dancing around, and my left side going numb. my face drooped. i lost my shit. 

i don't know what caused me to seize after they did my scans (two CTs, a chest x-ray, and an MRI) but it hit me so hard that so many capillaries had burst in my face i looked like i had been scalded by a spray of super hot water. i hallucinated into the next day and had to sleep with the lights on just so my room would stop moving around me. i'm honestly shocked they even let me go home. all i have now is some sensory agitation; a TIA makes sense as i used to have a /wicked/ mouth spasm when i would talk that sometimes just made it impossible to get out that i assumed i had developed due to ptsd as the timeline of events lines up, and i've been suffering memory lapses that i just chalked off as an untreated symptom of my acute ADHD. the spasm is just...gone now. my health has always been pretty good, i'm a stubborn son of a bitch and it typically takes an end of the world scenario to take me out. you name it i've probably been through it (except that). but this is blindsiding. i've taken the week from work to sort of...grieve, and process while i get ready to meet with a neurologist in the next three days.

one part of me is just scared out of my mind, while another more rational side of myself is accepting that this is just what it is, and all that i can do is push forward. i've always been an optimist. there's always been a bright side, and mine is that i'm still alive, and mostly well. my future just seems as though, admittedly, it's a little bleaker. i just don't know how to recollect myself. it's a grim reminder of my mortality, and while i'm not scared of dying, i'm scared of leaving the ones i love behind to deal with it if i go. i know, i know, i'm being dramatic. but the fear is still there. i'm scared to sleep. i'm scared i won't wake up.

As the title suggests, my grandma suffered a major stroke and is now in the hospital. Sadly, she's in critical condition. I have yet to see her (going to see her this morning) but according to my family she's paralyzed on her right side, cannot swallow or breathe on her own, cannot talk, and can barely open her eyes. She was flown to a different hospital to have surgery and at first things were going well but now the doctor says she has swelling in her brain and thinks it unlikely she will live past a few days.

No one has had a stroke in my family before (at least that I know of) so I don't know what to do or what to expect. I'm sad. Sad to see my mom cry the way she has been for her mom these past couple of days. 

My mom was talking about the whole thing and she says she can see my grandma is alert at times and she does squeeze her one hand when you do hold it but she cannot talk and barely opens her eyes. My family is trying to decide what to do should she indeed pass away. But it makes me wonder: Does she know what's happening? Does she know she's dying? Does she see and recognize us all there with her in the waiting room? Does she get a say on what might happen next? I don't know. Maybe I don't want to know? 

Thank you for reading this.",2021-07-04 07:16:34+00:00,"[""I am so sorry. Speaking as someone who has been extremely close to death, after I had surgery to remove as much cancer as they could I camethisclosetodeath. I knew I was that close though no one said those words to me. It was not at all scary. I felt very calm and actually comforted. I have always believe that our spirits are eternal though our bodies are what dies. Not long after I recovered from that my mom passed. She was in hospice and all of the family who could be there were. While everyone else was crying I did feel calm knowing that all of the physical, and mental (she had dementia) pain mom had would soon be over. When she did pass there was such a peace in the room that everyone felt. I am sure your Grandma knows what us happening and if she could she would let you all know. Squeezing your Mom's hand is probably her way of reassuring her. Opening your eyes takes a lot of energy at times. I hope this all makes sense. ‚ù§"", 'Your grandma sounds like my mom. No history of it in our family at all. The only close enough thing is me having epilepsy along with an uncle who had it and passed away. He suffered a seizure and he fell and passed. But no strokes or other conditions. \n\nMy mom had her stroke a few weeks back. If you look at my profile you‚Äôll see my posts. I‚Äôm without words. My mom is 49 years old. I am 23. I literally had a close to two hour conversation with her the night before. I remember it so well but not well enough? Does that make sense? \n\nMy mom cried the day before she went into a coma. I was talking to her through video chat before her brain was set to start swelling. They were starting her on medication to reduce the swelling and everything was looking good. I live out of state so throughout these days I was told not to come. But that day. The day before she went into the coma she looked terrified. She was crying with whatever she had control of (right side just like your grandma) and she looked scared. It hurt me so much and I could see she was scared because she thought she was going to die or like she knew something was up. \n\nThe next day I get the phone call telling me that she went into a coma because she swelled a lot. They told my sister and them that they would all be allowed to see her before she passed. They were scrambling to get a doctor to perform emergency surgery. Did I mention she has a heart problem? And they diagnosed her with type 2 diabetes. These were things we didn‚Äôt know at all before. \n\nAnyways I live a few states away. It was crushing every bit of me. They told me I had hours to say my goodbyes and to get there ASAP. The only flight was one for $470‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt have that. It was crushing me because all I wanted was my mommy. I know it sounds childish but I did. I wanted to tell her how much she‚Äôs meant to me. How I want to hear her beautiful voice again. And have her hold me and hug me. And how is make her so proud. \n\nI resorted to praying for her. She was always strong in her faith. I called my extended family and I was upset. I was yelling at the top of my lungs and telling them why they told me not to go. Why they told me it was going to be fine and it wasn‚Äôt. I knew why my mom looked scared the day before. I think she knew. She must have known and me and her out of all my family were the closest. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it in time. \n\nThe surgeon called back and said that he was able to do the surgery but needed them to sign the approval. My family was 40 minutes away from the hospital since it‚Äôs in a different city. The states capital to be exact. They told them that wouldn‚Äôt be enough time and she‚Äôd be dead by then. They then were able to get some emergency authorization over the phone to consent to it. He said he‚Äôd try but she would probably bleed out at that point since she was on a ventilator she was kept alive that way. The surgery was her best bet. They cut her skull to allow the swelling to go up so it wouldn‚Äôt snap her brain stem as it was about to do. She was already in a coma so even if she made it through the surgery it wasn‚Äôt a guarantee she would ever wake up. \n\nMy family tried to keep me updated but I was just numb. I had done all my crying the days leading up and had screamed and yelled through all I could. I just sat in my bed. Looking at my phone. Looking at her pictures. Listening to the last voicemail I have of her. Her wishing me a happy birthday the month before. \n\nI got the call later saying she made it through the surgery but was still in a coma and it‚Äôs hard to know if she‚Äôd wake up. Strokes and neurological issues are tough. Things that can be unknown. It‚Äôs just how it is, and I know very well because of my seizures. \n\nMy family insisted I stay calm because I have epilepsy and I can‚Äôt risk getting sick which I understand but it‚Äôs not my main concern. I got a flight the next day for $118. I arrived and went to the hospital right away (father drove me). When I arrived they made me wait but eventually I got in and they told me she came out of her coma and off the ventilator the hour before I arrived and she was able to look at me. I saw her and she had no hair. She looked barely alive. She didn‚Äôt completely recognize me and I could see her head/brain swollen through the scalp. It was pulsating up. \n\nThey needed to change her so they made me go outside in the waiting room and I lost it. I knew it was my mom but it‚Äôs just crazy. She didn‚Äôt look the same. She can‚Äôt talk to me. They told us she may never talk again. She‚Äôs in rehab now at her 3rd hospital but she‚Äôs not independent. It doesn‚Äôt look like she ever will. Her blood is still clotting and they don‚Äôt know why. Her blood sugar is up so her diabetes may be type 1 instead of 2. Nothing official yet. And she still has blood clots in her brain that are just there. She looks better and such in regards to recognizing things and understanding. But not the same. And it breaks me. It breaks me. I stay strong and act like nothing is wrong with her. I tell her it‚Äôs all fine and have normal conversations but it hurts me not being able to take care of her like I want. I‚Äôm assuming your mom may be going through the same. And maybe you. It‚Äôs tough. \n\nLast year I went into cardiac arrest. I was 21 since it was about a month before my 22nd birthday. Now im 23. Doctors get surprised reading my chart sometimes. I was on a ventilator and was dying. My body kept giving up on me. Yeah. I knew I was dying. Maybe it‚Äôs not a stroke but I was close to death if not there. And it didn‚Äôt hurt. I didn‚Äôt feel bad or scared until after the fact when I lived. During it I felt tired and wanted to sleep. It didn‚Äôt hurt because it felt like I was going to rest. They kept trying to get me to breathe on my own and stay alive but I couldn‚Äôt even try. I really tried though. The respiratory tech was actually shaking me hard and nudging me but it registered as like a weak shake? I could tell now he was shaking and nudging me hard but it was so delayed on my end. \n\nThings in life are weird. I cried typing this up. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt answer your question. Or it does. If you have any questions for me. DM me. Or ask away. In still learning this stuff with my mom. I am looking into raising more awareness because stuff like this doesn‚Äôt feel like it will happen to you until it does. Never in 100 years would I have thought. If you‚Äôre a person of faith. Pray. My mom is here by a miracle. She‚Äôs struggling and we all have hope she will get better. She wasn‚Äôt going to make it that day but I truly believe it was a miracle by God and also that doctor. Something happened because he wasn‚Äôt sure she‚Äôd even live. His best guess would be it would be late and she‚Äôd bleed out on the table in the middle. I‚Äôll keep your grandma in my thoughts and prayers.', ""So sorry you are going through this, it absolutely sucks :( My grandmother also suffered a stroke that she was unable to survive. I don't think anyone knows for sure but when she was in home hospice it did seem like she recognized us in some ways. I don't think she understood though what was going on really. I suspect it was more like she was dreaming or at the very edge of consciousness before waking, you hear voices that you recognize but you don't comprehend anything. Sending virtual hugs to you and your family. It's so hard to be thrown something like this all of a sudden.

I just knew I was in a hospital and was waiting to be taken to rehab.  My neurosurgeon didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd survive either, or if I did, he thought it would be in a vegetative state.  I have left side paralysis but I‚Äôm not dead or a vegetable.    I tell you this to bring you some hope but also know my young age also helped tremendously, I‚Äôll say a prayer for your grandma and family.', 'Treat it like she does know. Good luck.', 'You‚Äôre a good grandkid. I‚Äôm sorry you and your family are going through this. \n\nWhen the brain is that swollen, you‚Äôre mostly asleep. You can sometimes be woken by really strong stimuli (that‚Äôs probably when she tries to open her eyes), but it‚Äôs like being asleep. When other organs are the problem, but the brain is ok, people may know that they‚Äôre close to passing. But the brain is different, and ‚Äúmassive‚Äù strokes make that recognition pretty tough. She probably doesn‚Äôt consciously know how sick she is. \n\nYour grandma may or may not know that your family is with her, but the smart guess is that she does know. Patients who are really out of it from strokes respond better to the voices of loved ones than to the voices of the medical staff. Even if they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs being said, there must be something extra or special about the voice of a loved one. To me, that‚Äôs evidence of recognition. And remember, at bare minimum, you can‚Äôt hurt her by being there.\n\nSending you love over the internet.']",690

Trouble in the bathroom after a stroke can be extremely frustrating and embarrassing, which is why I wanted to cover 4 tools that can be really helpful if you have one-sided weakness, trouble with grip or manipulation, or problems with reaching behind you.

There‚Äôs no shame if you have a little trouble wiping yourself. Maintaining independence in the bathroom is a huge part of what I cover as an occupational therapist. I hope you find this video helpful!

If you feel comfortable sharing, let me know what‚Äôs worked for you!

My grandmother has a stroke 2 days ago. It was major. She's had very minor strokes in the past where they haven't impacted her too much or at all even. I remember getting her tea and meds ready and I came back from the kitchen to find her leaning over on the couch. I called out to her and she didn't respond at all. I found the left side of her body had gone totally limp. Since my dad and I know of her previous strokes, we thought she would just be able to ""get out"" of this one. She didn't. We talked to her. Tried to slowly fix her posture. Waited.. waited.. nothing. Eventually I told my dad that it's best we get her to the ER bc in that moment I knew that the longer we'd wait, the more permanent her condition would potentially become. We took her in. They did CT scans, blood tests, x-rays. The neurologist confirmed that she suffered a major stroke on the right side of her brain. My grandmother has been in all sorts of conditions from illnesses and operations. We've seen it and we've dealt with it. But this time it just felt like a complete shock. It's two days after and her vitals are stable, thank God. She's in a really deep sleep. She's not at all concious enough to do anything. She moves a bit in her sleep, coughs, yawns and if I tough her head/ hair, she moves creases her eyebrows. She's currently on a glucose and protein IV drip since she obviously can't eat or swallow.

Covid restrictions has set us back with visiting her. We saw her today for 15 minutes then had to leave. I'm aware she needs all the rest she can get right now from her brain to heal from the trauma/ shock. Obviously with her age and general health, things are bound to hit her harder than any healthier and younger individual. I'm just worried about how long she's going to stay in this deep sleep. If anyone who suffered with this after their stroke or know's someone that did.. what is the transition period post-stroke where the individual become for capable and aware? Or atleast is more wakeful than sleeping excessively?

I needed to rant about all of this. I love my grandmother too much and although it's been tough looking after her, I'd do it again and again no matter what.

694,My mother had a stroke... as I predicted...,9,o4mlf1,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/o4mlf1/my_mother_had_a_stroke_as_i_predicted/,7,"Tbh I don't really know where to begin so forgive me if I don't immediately go straight to the point. 

Please understand that whatever I am going to say is for at the very least to hear the advice of people who might have some experience on this matter in order to help my mother and myself who always like to think negatively...

I would like to make it clear that I never got along with my mother. She's one of those parents that thinks she's always right, she even says so herself. I hated that personality of hers and if I wasn't raised by my relatives I would have probably ended up like her. Almost everyday we have these fights regarding her eating unhealthy foods that may lead to a stroke (She's 51 and has diabetes and hypertension), but I never had the courage to say the word stroke. I refer to it as something ""unfortunate where to happen"" or something along those lines every time we have an argument. My father and siblings of course didn't give a f\*\*\*. They always responded to me, ""let her be and mind your own business"".

My mother if I were to describe is a person you ***NEVER*** want to be with in a crisis. She's the type of person that would probably incite panic on everyone involved and get them all killed. She isn't obese just overweight, she has diabetes so worse that she had diabetic retinopathy when she was in her mid 40's and the slightest of problems like not paying the electricity bill on time would make her crazy due to her hypertension. So it doesn't take a genius to realize that she has a high risk of a stroke considering her diet of oily foods and softdrinks.

I know for myself that I couldn't just ignore it, because at the end of day it would be my problem. So the very least I could do was to always warn her whenever she's eating something stupid which always lead to banters.

Then of course it happened... it happened way too fast... 

We couldn't find any private hospitals that weren't full so we went to a public hospital which were also full because of covid, but they still accommodated us. My mother was stuck on the emergency room for 2 days... I am no medical student so I have no idea what kind of first aid they treated her with but they assured us that her condition was at the very least stable... There's also no CT-Scan available on that hospital and there's no Neurologist available to accurately read the results either... So we had to pull some strings and have her transferred to another hospital outside the city and it took 2 days to make it happen.

The hospital we transferred on were fully equipped. After the scan it was revealed that my mother suffered a **Haemorrhagic stroke.** I thought I hated her, but I couldn't sleep for days when it happened, I cried for many hours whenever I am alone, and I just didn't want to wake up after sleeping. At that point reality was worse... but I had to stay strong, because only I could do it... I stayed and slept inside the hospital alone for days. I was very naive and I probably have some kind of trauma because hospitals aren't for the faint of heart. The stories I've heard and the people I've met there aren't even as lucky as us... I probably knew, but I just chose to ignore it.

My feelings weren't that of anger, but it has been replaced with grief. I previously thought I had to fake crying if she does indeed kick the bucket, but it was the exact opposite... Every time I visited her I had to hold back my tears and show her there's nothing to worry about.. She can only speak one word... it's like she reverted into a baby... the right side of her body was completely paralyzed... She's awake, but I can tell she can't recognize me... I just felt hopeless... but I had to show a face without worries. I could only appreciate wearing facemasks, because she would've probably noticed me biting my lips.

I don't really want to make this too long so I would just advance the story a week after we left the hospital and my mother had a few therapy.

My mother is currently:

\- Still acts like a baby  
\- She always and I mean always cries and goes into tantrums  
\- She still can't speak and can only mutter one word  
\- She can't sleep (she had insomnia before the stroke happened due to her worrying about nonsense, please just take my word on it that she doesn't really have any significant problems in her life specially financially)  
\- Her eyes wander off somewhere else whenever we're talking to her (can't make proper eye contact)  
\- She can't understand verbal instructions, but can somehow understand physical instruction  
\- She can't accurately differentiate colors.  
\- She doesn't recognize family members, but she did smile seeing them the first time... and only that time..  
\- Physically I do think she has a very high chance of achieving recovery although half of her body is still paralyzed..

I am very sorry if I missed some details, I just want to know if my mother's consciousness would come back... It's closing to 1 month since it happened...

 I am just very tired...

Thank you.",2021-06-21 04:02:11+00:00,"['I can emphasize with you completely, this happened to my step-dad last month. I don\'t have much advice but I am so sorry you are going through this too. Our stories are very similar and you are not alone.\n\nMe and my mum begged my step dad for years to look after his health, he ate so unhealthy and smoked alot. He was too stubborn to listen and much like your mum was ""always right"" and I hated him for it. Then it happened. His stoke was caused by severe hypotension and is now in the same position as your mum. \n\nAll I can say is try to not think too negatively, the worst has happened, don\'t waste your energy worrying about the hypotheticals or ""what ifs"". Take each day at a time. Recovery is slow but definitely possible, I feel it takes alot of encouraging but the small improvements make you feel there is a light and the end of the tunnel. A nurse also told me we should adjust to our new normal as although he might not be the same as before the stroke, life can still be good. There is hope.\n\nWell done for putting on a brave face too, it\'s really hard. It is so emotionally exhausting too, I know how tired you must be. Try and look after yourself as well because I feel the shock of seeing someone after a stroke can be traumatizing in itself. Do you have anyone close to talk through this? I\'m in the uk so we might have different healthcare systems but there could be charities/support for both yourself and your mum. I wish you the best.', 'Every stroke is different. We say that a lot, so it may sound trite, but it\'s true, every stroke is different, so we can\'t generalize. Nothing is 100% about it. Your mother\'s caregivers have a professional opinion, they have a better idea and more information than we do, so they can give a better guess than we can, but even then they can be wrong sometimes. Like with me - first they said I would likely die, then they said I\'d be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of  my life, then they said that I could maybe hobble about with a walker, then a quad-cane, then a single cane (which I still have), then I\'d be in care for at least years, then they sent me home but I was likely to die in 3-4 months, then maybe 10, then I\'m likely to live for decades if I have heart surgery and medication won\'t help, then maybe medication might help, then medication *did* help. But even then, when friends tell me that they perceive me as my old self again, they have no idea how hard it is for me to make that happen, how much more mental energy I have to put into everything to act ""normal"".\n\nThat said, I was never in as bad shape as your mother, even at my worst, so I encourage you *not* to think ""well, /u/themcp made a full recovery, so my mother can too."" I suggest you set some expectations: if she\'s in that condition after some time, it\'s likely she is never going to be 100% again. Even at best, she is going to have a lot of difficulty. (You can\'t even begin to imagine how difficult it was for me to achieve the gains I have... and she\'s going to have a lot harder time of it.) Understand that as time passes, the chance of recovery goes down - a stroke patient needs to be working hard on recovery as soon as possible because after about a year they lose a lot of chance to ever recover and after about 2 years they\'re probably stuck with their condition. (This isn\'t *entirely* true, people can recover forever, but it gets so much harder after about 2 years that only the most motivated patients will make even a little progress.) A stroke patient needs to make more or less continuous progress, not ""they\'re still as bad as they were, there\'s no real change."" \n\nOf the things you listed ""she can\'t sleep"" is *bad*. You may think many of the other things are worse, but most stroke victims can barely keep their eyes open: the brain wants to repair itself, and sleeping gives it a chance to do some of that. If she can\'t sleep, the brain doesn\'t have a lot of chance to repair itself. Insomnia is not necessarily stress related, to some extent it\'s biological, so her not being able to sleep is not necessarily related to her being stressed about anything, and it\'s very bad if she can\'t get some rest.\n\nGiven that you list a number of ways in which she is failing to communicate, I wonder how ""she can\'t differentiate colors"" is determined. How can you know if the problem is ""she can\'t differentiate colors"" or if it\'s ""she can\'t successfully communicate about differentiation of colors"" or if it\'s ""she doesn\'t understand what is being asked of her""? \n\n""Physically I do think she has a very high chance of achieving recovery""... why? \n\n""although half of her body is still paralyzed""... that\'s not good, she\'s going to have a very hard time if that doesn\'t begin to come back, but that *can* happen - my great grandfather had a stroke at 92 in 1971 and was paralyzed in half his body and made a ""full recovery"" on his own - in 1971 when a 92 year old had a stroke, they told the family ""he\'s doing to die"" and gave the patient no therapy. He wasn\'t ready to die.\n\nI know this isn\'t the answer you want to hear. You want optimism and cheer. However, I wouldn\'t be being kind to you to falsely raise your expectations only to have them crushed by reality. Hope for the best (with some management of your own expectations of what ""the best"" can actually be) and prepare for the worst.', ""My dad had a stroke when I was thirteen so forgive me if the details are hazy. I recall that he didn't remember me and that he was in the hospital for some time. (Weeks? Months?) But he made almost a full recovery. His memory was never the same after, but everything else was. He's into his 80s now and is still very active. So there's a  chance that you're mom can recover. Just have to give her time."", ""It is vitally important you take care of yourself. If that means going through the hospital staff to get updates that is something you should do. I think an interesting aspect of rehabilitation is it goes much better if you push yourself. So unless she will do that she won't get much better and rehabilitation itself is long grueling work, on the part of the person needing it. But above all, don't light yourself on fire to keep your mom warm, especially if she likely wouldn't repay the favor. Best of luck to you and your family!"", 'First this is not your fault. You did what you could but your mom made the choices on her own and was stubborn about it. Despite that You are showing amazing strength and your family is lucky to have someone like you. but I think you are allowed to cry even in front of mom and not take this all on your own. This is a lot to bear for you without some medical guidance. \n\nDid the hospital not recommend inpatient acute rehabilitation for her? She would receive some weeks of therapy daily there. Afterwards if she were to go home, they often refer her to outpatient rehab. She cold benefit from PT, OT, and ST (physical, occupational, snd speech). They can at least help you and your family  better understand stroke assistance, building independence, and maximizing what potential she may have. \nThey complete family training too. This should not all be on you and I would get other family members involved as well in the training snd participation of taking her to rehab. \n\nL I can‚Äôt give medical advice over the internet so please check with a doctor about these choices and making a referral for at least outpatient rehab. \n\nLastly this is not all on you and you‚Äôve been amazing trying to prevent this situation, because no one else cared to do so.

701,OT Tip: P is for...,10,nhs62o,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nhs62o/ot_tip_p_is_for/,0,"**P is for pain.**

Up to [70% of stroke survivors experience post-stroke pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402053/). From that same study, up to 20% of survivors experience post-stroke depression, and 40% experience fatigue, which often occurs alongside pain. There are multiple types of pain that can occur post-stroke: generalized, neurological, musculoskeletal, painful spasticity, and shoulder pain. These types of pain can overlap so a survivor may experience more than one type of pain at the same time.

There are two types of pain that can be a bit more difficult to diagnose and treat:

1. **Central Post-Stroke Pain (CPSP)**: Anywhere between [1-25% of survivors will deal with CPSP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19679277/). This is also known as central nervous system pain or thalamic pain. This pain is different and has some funky side effects. If you have CPSP, you may find that symptoms are made worse by seemingly normal occurrences like loud noises, weather changes, and emotional stress. It can be tricky for doctors to diagnose because of the variation of symptoms between survivors.  
‚Äã
2. **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS):** CRPS used to be known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD). CRPS [occurs anywhere between 2-49% ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6511009_Complex_regional_pain_syndrome_in_stroke_patients)of stroke survivors. It can be tough to treat and present as a spontaneous pain that is continuous or fluctuates with activity. It can also present as excessive pain after contact with something or use. Physical characteristics include a change in skin texture or color, swelling, abnormal sweating, increased hair growth, and impaired strength or movement.

If you have any type of pain after a stroke, don't hesitate to talk to your PCP or neurologist about it. You are your best advocate.",2021-05-21 13:11:27+00:00,[],702

**‚Äã**  
**‚Äã**I'm sure ya'll saw this one coming :) An [evidence-based review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281705/) published in 2014 reviewed 39 articles on the efficacy of occupational therapy on improving function and independence in the ADLs (activities of daily life) of stroke survivors. Unsurprisingly, the researchers found that engaging in occupations (the things that occupy your daily life), helps improve outcomes!  
‚Äã  
We also know from research on neuroplasticity that engaging in activities that are important and relevant to you, helps improve neuroplastic brain changes. The brain likes things it's familiar with. Kleim and Jones (2008) reported in their article, [Principles of Plasticity](https://www.jsmf.org/meetings/2008/may/Kleim%20&%20Jones%202008.pdf), that motivation, attention, and stimulation of reward centers in the brain all help to increase participation in the rehab process. Someone will usually be more motivated to participate in something they find relevant and valuable.

So if you're still in the recovery process at home, do something important to you as part of your home therapy. For example, if you like cooking, make a meal. If you enjoy yard work, go play in the dirt. Keep doing things you enjoy, as much as you can!",2021-05-20 13:14:25+00:00,[],703
703,Disability Insurance insisting neuro psych test. Worried about outcome,9,n6lj3o,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n6lj3o/disability_insurance_insisting_neuro_psych_test/,12,"Last December I had a brain stem stroke.   Lost 30% of my right side, see double, can't deal with multiple inputs like more than three people or walking through a grocery store.

I used to be a project manager and lead 6-12 person meetings all day.  Now I can't even do a one hour zoom call.

Disability has insisted on a neuro psych test.  It's going to be 7 hours long.  Most people advise relaxing the day before and getting a good night's sleep.

I'm actually worried that I will do too well.   I tend to 'overachieve' on tests and am fiercely competitive with myself.   I want to do well and get a good understanding of what I'm dealing with.  However, I'm afraid of doing too well.  If I come through well, disability may either not pay my claim or insist I go back to work.  I'm in no way ready.  I had to ditch out a meal in a noisy restaurant with three other people due to overload.  Yesterday I went to see an exhibit at a museum and had to bail before the end.  It's been about 30 hours past and I'm still feeling slightly dizzy and the side of my face is numb.  I sometimes go through a whole night without sleeping with no idea why besides the brain stem stroke.  But some days are so good I occasionally forget I had a stroke.

So, do I try to 'tank' the test so that I get more time to recover?  Do I do the best I can so I can get an accurate read for myself and therapy?  Or something in between?

Not only disability, but the test will determine how much therapy I get from insurance.  Insurances are insisting on access to the test results so I can't keep it to myself.

Ideas?

EDIT: I would not purposely give an answer I knew was wrong.  I might however do a five count pause at the end of reading each instructional sentence.  My goal is not to collect insurance longer than I needed to, but to be given the time to make and get all the recovery before therapy is taken away.",2021-05-07 00:03:50+00:00,"['Many tests have ways to root out intentional failing.

A couple of weeks ago I had two events a couple of days apart.  I am early 50's.

I lost motor skills and slight numbness on my left hand side, fell over and couldn't get dressed after coming out of the shower, with slurred speech, massive tremors, some dystonia, difficulty finding words, and dull headache around the back of my head near my neck.

Ambulance, lights flashing, CT scan, EKG and full neurological blood panels.

Both times CT scans showed no bleeding, EKG was pretty normal. Blood pressure 130/90. Blood panel only showed raised cholesterol.  They stuck me on a loading dose of blood thinners and gave me a statin.

My neurologist said I likely had an stroke in my cerebellum.

I am going for a morning of cardio tests in a couple of days.

Since the event I have been very tired. I guess that is normal. 

More worrying is I having waves of what I can only say seem like acute severe Parkinson's once or twice a day. 

I can switch in minutes to full on tremors, difficulty standing up and speaking, being cold (esp fingers and toes), and just sheer terror. 

After about an hour or so things return to baseline tiredness and dull head pain and brain fog.

I am totally new to this.  Does this all sound typical?

Should I ask for a CTA or anything else.  I am desperate to get to the bottom of it. 

It just happened *again* and I am freaking out.  Two hours later I am able to post on reddit again. Wtf. I don't want to die or have a much worse stroke.

A simple place to start is to think of **one thing** you're grateful for. It can be something you're able to do, a relationship, your home, the food you eat, or simply the sun shining in the sky. Then think of one new thing you're grateful for the next day and so on.

I'm not saying it's easy. Gratitude can be a difficult practice, especially for those who have gone through trauma.

But if you can find a place for it in your life, you may find that [gratitude makes you happier](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier#:~:text=In%20positive%20psychology%20research%2C%20gratitude,express%20gratitude%20in%20multiple%20ways.), improves your health, helps you overcome challenges, and allows you to build stronger relationships.",2021-03-23 14:46:37+00:00,"[' ‚ÄúExercise is a celebration of what your body can do.

712,Need advice for father's post-stroke living situation,9,mbe98k,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/mbe98k/need_advice_for_fathers_poststroke_living/,9,"I would like to start with this sub has been a great help over the last few months. I often get down about my father's situation and come here to read stories of recovery that remind me there is hope. 

&#x200B;

My father had a stroke Dec. 27, 2020 at the age of 67. We don't know exactly when it occurred, but is had to be some time after Christmas day. My sister got a call from him the morning of the 27th and immediately went to take him to a hospital because of the way he was speaking. The MRI came back and he had a clot in the left basil ganglia. At this time he had no paralysis or major confusion, but was showing signs of expressive aphasia. The hospital told us we were in luck as one of the best surgeons in the area was just getting out of surgery and said he would do the procedure. Our options were to do the procedure, or start therapy since the time the stroke occurred was not known. We were told the risks of complications were less than 1% and  that the operation would take about 45 minutes. Well, long story short, that was not the case. We got a call 3 hours later to tell us that they tried to remove the clot and place the stent 3 times with no success. Now my father is paralyzed on his right side, is incontinent, and has global aphasia and apraxia. 

&#x200B;

He is currently in a specialized rehabilitation facility in our city, but we will be bringing him home in another month. He lives in a 1 bedroom loft downtown, which he absolutely loves, but given the level of care he will need for the foreseeable future, I do not believe this will be the best place for him. My sister has expressed interest in staying with him to care for him, but there are certain things I know she cannot do such as changing him or bathing him. I also want him to work as hard as possible on therapy, so I would like to have as much rehab equipment as is reasonable in the home for at-home therapist to use with him. Given his place is a loft, there is obviously not much space for that kind of thing.

&#x200B;

My question is, how much space is really needed for recovery? I would like to buy him a house with multiple rooms for family/nursing to stay in, as well as a home gym to aid in his rehab.  He is very limited physically, ie wheelchair-bound and transfers are still difficult, and communication with him is still 90% one direction. A concern from my family is that he will be much better in 6-12 months and not need a large space anymore and want to go back to the loft. While I hope constantly for that, I don't think it's a reasonable expectation. My family and I have no experience with anything close to this, so I was hoping to get some feedback from this community.",2021-03-23 13:03:57+00:00,"['I‚Äôd think of this way. Keep his loft so that if sister does stay with him to take care of him she will need a place to go relax and chill. Caretaking is very emotionally and physically draining. \n\nGetting a house that can handle a wheelchair with all that you want would be good. There is the fact that folks do really well in familiar situations but Having space for in care workers is great and it is really a lot for your sister to take on alone. \n\nWhen my ex FIL was dealing with cancer and his alcoholism, that 6‚Äô5 320 lbs man..  he fell once and I couldn‚Äôt get him up. This would possibly devastate the sister to be in such a position. \n\nBut her being there with him. Helping him, cooking and cleaning will be a great comfort to him. She just needs to realize there will be times she might need to push him a little bit and not let him slack off. \n\nIf you can help your dad and work together I think he will recover that much faster.', ""I'm glad you're thinking of your options now. This is good. My dad had a very similar experience. He was in an intense rehab facility for a month and as we neared the end of his stay the staff was very helpful. \n\nThey asked questions about the layout of the home. How many steps to get in, rails, shower vs bath, handrails in the shower, etc. For example we have one step to enter our home so they worked with my dad to get him prepped for taking that one step. We even had a few tries of having him get in and out of our cars. We had to remodel our shower so that he could have easier access and we also added a ramp for his wheelchair.\n\nThe week before his release his caseworker went through a checklist of items we would need. Shower chair, hospital bed, bedside commode, wheelchair, oxygen, transfer board, and quad cane. These were all provided by insurance and were delivered before he was sent home. He was also given speech, occupational, and physical therapy in home. Once he was strong enough he started going to a facility for therapy.\n\nNow I won't lie to you the first month of him being home were extremely difficult for us. Although we have a little background with medical it was still a big transition. We all had to watch and assist with cleaning while he was in the hospital so we can understand and be able to do it on our own. I believe that your sister will definitely be able to learn how to clean him up. Insurance was able to provide a nurse aide to shower my dad 3 times a week. We would give him bed baths in between. \n\nI'm glad you're working on this early on but take into consideration everything I've shared and speak to his case manager. Make an informed decision and get everyone on board before making such a big change. You want what's best for him in the end I get that so do what you think is best once you've weighed all of your options."", ""Depending on how big the loft is, it may be workable- is there a place for a hospital bed? Isi the bathroom big enough to fit his wheelchair, or one of the narrower wheelchairs just for bathrooms?  \n\nMy dad had a stroke right before Christmas, and he's been out of the rehab place for about a month. He's paralyzed on his left side. He can use a sit-to-stand device with help (Lumex- if your dad has any left side strength, I higly recommend- it's a godsend for us). Honestly, he really doesn't need a ton of space. The bathroom fits a shower chair while he's actually showering (otherwise it's stored in the laundry room), the sit-stand fits by the toilet so he can sit down from it onto the toilet, and he has a hospital bed in the bedroom. he spends probably 5-6 hours a day in his wheelchair in front of the TV, and the vast majority of his PT happens within 1-2 feet of his wheelchair so he can sit down. He practices using a walker, but only really needs 8 feet or so in front of him and then we sit him down in his wheelchair, pull him back to the start, and go again. \n\nIn terms of rehab equipment, we have: his wheelchair, the sit-to-stand, a folding hemi walker. That's it. Most of the rehab they do is either bodyweight (standing, sitting, marching, bridging in bed) or uses household items. \n\nMy dad has made a lot of progress in a month. I would really, really suggest holding off for 6-8 weeks to see how things are going- he's made so much progress with the walking even in the last month that I'm glad we didn't start remodeling our house (or looking for a new one). Also, as someone else said, the change of location from a house he loves to a new place would have caused significant cognitive issues for him. Also, would have pissed him off and he's already angry enough."", ""Hi, my mum had stroke before age 70 and I was her caregiver so I know what u r experiencing.  U don't need a lot of space-just decent space to manoevre a wheelchair but not too tight such that turning the wheelchair becomes difficult.  The room should hv sufficient space to fit a bed of e size that is comfortable for yr dad and space to park the wheelchair and commode (if needed) nearby but not right by the bedside when not in use. \n\nWhat type of equipment is needed to facilitate his recovery -get advice FM therapists.

On my last post you all offered great advice and I plan to ask for: more blood work, a CT scan, and a transesophageal echocardiogram.

721,OT Tip: Understanding & Treating Spasticity,9,ll71ec,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ll71ec/ot_tip_understanding_treating_spasticity/,3,"**What Is Spasticity?**

* Essentially, spasticity after stroke is muscle tightness that is abnormal and results from prolonged contraction and stiffness.
* Spasticity is different from high muscle tone, in that it is velocity-dependent. This means that moving the affected limb quickly will cause it ‚Äúcatch.‚Äù

**Why Does It Happen?**

* We have pathways that transmit signals from the body to the brain and vice versa in order to produce movement.
* When someone has a stroke, the brain may receive signals from the body, but the signal back to the body gets interrupted at some point.

**Co-Contraction**

* Instead of the muscles activating as they need to for movement, both flexors, and extensors (bending and straightening muscles) turn on at the same time, causing a co-contraction.

**Symptoms of Spasticity**

* This leads to pain, stiffness, and tightness in the affected limb causing difficulty with voluntary movement.

**Free At-Home Treatment**

* Cryotherapy (cold): 10-15 minutes of a cold pack to the affected muscle(s) can help decrease nerve conduction leading to reduced spasticity. Not long-lasting.
* Stretching: follow the application of cold with prolonged passive stretching which turns on Golgi tendon organs (responsible for muscle relaxation). This can help to lengthen the muscle.
* E-stim is another option that can help reduce spasticity, however, there is cost associated.

If so, what has helped you?**",2021-02-16 16:07:52+00:00,"['I have seriously tight spasticity,which worsens in cold and damp weather.I do daily stretching, apply ice and heat and a therapeutic masssager, but these have little effect.     cbd helps to relax the pain of the tightness.I use delta 8.', 'I wish i could turn off the tightness.

I first had my first symptom on June 2018, I felt dizzy and everything spinning around me. Things started to get worse one month or so after that, I had a second dizziness episode and I started to had blurred vision. Then everything appears to be gone until I decided to start doing CrossFit, and one day I started seeing a light, geometrical moving light in front of my left eye, that it didn‚Äôt go away no matter how much I rubbed my eyes, followed by one of the strongest headaches I ever had. After this the dizziness came back but stronger and more often, I went to neurologist, did some tests and found nothing.. my husband told me it was anxiety, i was living a nightmare between the dizziness episodes, blurred vision and headaches. One day after a CrossFit session the dizziness was so heavy I couldn‚Äôt stand from the floor, still I felt embarrassed and managed my self to get to the car and drive home, I try as hard as I could to walk straight and drive properly (really crazy and irresponsible) but when you‚Äôre living something as surreal as this, is difficult to convince yourself that is actually something wrong with your brain. Things keep carry on like this for the whole month of November and the 2nd of December 2019 I was having a nap, my husband was at home luckily because there was a guy installing some furniture and he needed to skip work to be there (thanks god) when out of nowhere I twisted in the bed changing position when I felt like an explosion inside my brain, and then gravity was gone on my left side, huge force pulling me toward the left down to the bed, I couldn‚Äôt pull my head or body, I could only scream to my husband for help, he run to my rescue and called the ambulance. Paramedics came and I beg them I couldn‚Äôt walk, they made me went down the stairs, I was melting in their arms, I felt I was going to die, in the ambulance I sort of lost notion of things but remember when I was at the clinic they left me waiting for some reason (obviously they didn‚Äôt know I was having a stroke) and there in the stretchers I couldn‚Äôt talk, or move my fingers of body with fine movement, like if I had brain paralysis. One nurse was asking me things and I couldn‚Äôt reply and I remember her saying to her colleagues ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt wanna talk to me‚Äù in an angry tone. Then they pass me to one room where my husband was waiting for me and little by little I started to regain all the talk and fine motion. The scan said everything was normal and I was discharged next morning. I remember I slept like a baby, i was death tired.

His stroke was moderate in size and was about a week old by the time they‚Äôd caught it. He has no physical residual effects and is able to do pretty much everything that he was able to do pre-stroke. He is back at work and took a driving test, on which he got a perfect score. His doctors cannot stress enough how lucky they believe he is. I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs still here because I love him so much and I need him.

He‚Äôs also forgotten random things that I know he‚Äôd never have forgotten otherwise. Movies we‚Äôve watched together, funny experiences we shared, details from TV shows.. he even forgot about our nicknames we had for each other when I was little. It all makes me very upset.

Is talking again likely?

I changed from a bright, intelligent woman into someone who was easily confused and had difficulty remembering things, hardly traits that could be used in any career field. To say I was devastated is putting it mildly.\n\nBecause of my age and no clear reason for the stroke, as well as the returning cognitive issues, I had seen various neurologists and finally ‚Äì FINALLY one neurologist clearly saw the damage from the stroke and also saw I had experienced several transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

She told me that sometimes people are so determined to recover, their brain responds to the efforts they make. I‚Äôll always be grateful for her insight because it gave me hope to deal with my memory issues.\n\nOver the years I have had periods of very satisfying positions, both full time and various freelance writing assignments. Those periods were punctuated with declining cognitive and mobility issues and several transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), but I never gave up. And I never gave in to negative thinking. I even wrote a fiction novel that was published.\n\nThere are so many groups that can provide information and support. I would encourage you to seek out resources via social services in your area through Google.\n\nThe **American Stroke Association** is an excellent place to start.

My father suffered a massive stoke in early April. He is currently in a skilled nursing facility recovering. As of now he cannot speak, is on a feeding tube, and has limited/no use of the left side of his body. 
&nbsp;
Before his stroke, he did not have a power of attorney set up, so my sister and I had to hire a lawyer to get appointed Guardianship and Conservatorship as we are his only living relatives.
&nbsp;

I'm just now starting the process of inventory of his assets and accounts, and I'm dealing with the guilt of having to potentially sell all of his stuff to pay for his care. As of right now, he still needs 24 hour care, so once his time in the nursing facility is up and the insurance runs out, we are looking at placing in an Adult Foster Home. 
&nbsp;

The hardest part is that he did not have a will or make his wishes known on what he would like done for his care/with his stuff, so I'm dealing with the guilt of taking on potentially selling his house without knowing what he would want done.

But like... what do I do? He is a little confused when he wakes up in the morning but then is okay during the day. I can tell that he is still really scared and he's scared to sleep. He also gets triggered by loud noises because he says they remind him of the MRI machine he was in.

I am obviously going to help him find a therapist to talk to, but I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I was thinking of playing a game of Scrabble every day? 

Is there anything I should be doing to help with his brain function? Is his confused state when waking a bad sign (like, do I need to call a doctor?)

I've already reached out to neurology to talk to a doctor, but they said it could take 2 days for them to call me back.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",2020-06-10 16:30:50+00:00,"['As a stroke survivor, let me offer my sympathies and some insight on how to move forward. \n    First, every stroke is different. There are broad patterns that may apply. For example, I smiled when I read what you wrote about his startle reflex. It may be spawned by the MRI but are probably just a result of brain trauma. Lots of stroke survivors struggle with getting overstimulated by sudden or loud  or just constant noises.  In the first year or two of my recovery, I could not handle riding in a car, At highway speeds I would feel panicked by the noises  bright lights or sunny days were overwhelming. It feels like anxiety  and seems weak or silly, but the old filters that allowed us to ignore a noise and focus elsewhere may no longer work. For me a crowded room, a zoom call with multiple  faces/voices or a conference call is still too much to handle. In my stroke I lost my divided attention, that is.the ability I used to have to do one thing but still tolerate and process distracting activity or noises. \n\nThe physical effects of a  significant stroke are often the most obvious, but the invisible effect can be more frustrating for the patient and the caregivers . The stroke may impact identity,self esteem,communication and outlook on the present and the future. \nBut as dreary as that all sounds, the brain is amazing and rehab can make significant progress and you can learn to compensate and accommodate for deficits going forward. \nI. E. Noise canceling headphones are glorious in cars  and planes. Sunglasses help  when light is a problem. \nBe sensitive to situations that may be over stimulating. \nBe patient in the recovery process. \nLearn to care for yourself.  Caregiving is hard work. \nFind a good stroke recovery support group for you both. \nListen to therapist recommendations. They know a lot about strategies to make life work following a stroke. There‚Äôs more to share but you‚Äôll find your way. It will be an adventure. Not easy but valuable and interesting. \nTake care and love well.', 'I‚Äôm sorry this happened to your fianc√©. My wife had a stroke at 27, so I have been through something similar.\n\nMy advice is: \n1) take help when people offer. If they make a general offer, you can ask for a meal to be made for you guys. \n2) take things one step at a time. Focus on helping with the meds first. Get on a schedule for that. Then start adding in a new piece like the exercise. \n3) make sure you get rest yourself. You will burn out if you ignore yourself. It sucks big time.\n4) you can give stuff like Scrabble, word searches, and crosswords a try, but don‚Äôt force them. There is a chance it will make him feel worse if he can‚Äôt do them. If it doesn‚Äôt work, move to something else.\n5) he‚Äôll need a lot of rest.

It's basically in the white matter, where all the teeny tiny arteries are. They control the higher brain functions, such as memory and emotion. I didn't even realize I had had mine. Just had a stomachache for a few days (which never happens, but it hurt enough to wake me up in the night, and then I had a visual aura, which had been happening very frequently that month.) I saw a neurologist the next week, at the recommendation of my opthamologist, and that's when they saw the stroke (on the MRI). I spent three days getting poked in the hospital, but they found no reason for me, a 32 year old with no history of strokes, no smoking, no high blood pressure, to have a stroke. They said I was fat and sent me on my merry way.\n\nI don't remember extreme fatigue, but I've always had brain fog/fatigue, and I do notice that I get tired more often. It's been three years, and I was in school for two of those years, and honestly that's probably the best thing i could have ever done. Since my doctors were completely useless, as well as the medication they prescribed, I've pretty much had to do everything on my own. I still take my blood thinner (baby aspirin tore up my GI tract, so i take an alka seltzer tablet every day instead), but nothing else.\n\nI learned lots of new vocabulary words, and i have a better grasp of my issues. I can type just fine, but sometimes i have difficulty explaining my thoughts. This is called aphasia. I lost all of my math and had to relearn at a basic level, but luckily i did okay, because I was able to take calculus last year, which is they highest math I've ever taken. I didn't lose my second language, but I have zero patience for computers. Isn't that weird?\n\nI also have hyperacusis, which may be what your husband is experiencing, so I would look into that. I wear filtered earplugs when the noise is too overwhelming. I also have pseudo bulbar effect, which is an emotional issue I think. Basically I start crying for absolutely *no* reason, and i just can't stop. There's a cool version where the person laughs a bunch, but i guess I'm not cool enough to get that! It happens maybe a couple of times a year.\n\nThe thing that got me the most was the depression and then the suicidal thoughts. I've battled depression most of my life. I had PPD pretty bad. But a new version of depression? Kicked my butt. I even started writing out a suicide note, and a list of all the things that I wanted to get done before I did it. What strange beings we are.\n\nBasically, a piece of your husband's brain died. He's going to do what he can to build new connections and overcome and recover, but it will take time, and a lot of patience. You know how little kids get frustrated with themselves when they can't do something? Or how teenagers get moody and exasperated and lash out? That's what you're going to be dealing with. Part of his brain is going to be fresh and young and developing, butting up with older parts that *know* something isn't quite right. A part of his personality might change, and might change forever. It's okay to not be okay with that. Get yourself a good support system, both for him *and* yourself.\n\nAnother thing that I found helpful was changing my diet. A diet high in fats and low in carbs helps with brain health. But really, any healthy diet will be beneficial. Staying away from trash food makes all the difference.\n\nA lot of that I had to learn on my own, and it's not a perfect record. And each brain, and each brain injury, is different. You will have to find your own new normal.\n\nBest of luck going forward.

 I am Italian, I am 53 now, around 2 years ago I got hit by a stoke, BY LUCK, with all the LUCK  of the word, and surely thank to the competence of  the doctors , after woken up in the intensive care unit, I found out I could not write or talk  anymore.  

But I could read in Italian and also in English with no problems. 

All the rest of me was still working fine 

6 months of speech therapy, enormous effort from me and family, and, I think, thanks to the fact I could work starting from month 6 after the stoke, little by little, one word after the other, one effort after the other, I recovered most of what i was before.

I still cannot talk in English, but even there I am improving..

So my message to all reading this post, is, there is hope, we can improve well beyond the 6 months, I am still improving after 2 years !!!!  Be strong, find something you like and work at it, at all times. I wish you all luck

Two questions :

o On the minor things, I lost some sensitivity on my right hand, and i do not care much of it. But at the same time I started to feel cold on the right arm, during winter and part of the spring I wear a  glove ( with cutted egde so i can type on a keybord ) 

o Need to rest, I need to rest, even today,  at least 10 hours each night, and also during the day, in general i try to rest 30 mins at luch time, and often after work i again need to rest 30mins. 1hour it depends on the day, on the weather outside, on how much I talked or wrote during the day‚Ä¶

First, I gotta say that I'm glad this sub exists. I've been trying to help my dad over the last year since he had his stroke (November 2018, I was coming over every day to do his physical therapy exercises and I'm still coming over every day to go on walks) and he's recovered really well - he has full function with some odds and ends like what I've seen described here: easily fatigued, tingling sometimes, and he sometimes has a hard time recalling words. 


I'm wondering for folks here who've been through strokes or had family members who've been through strokes, how people have dealt with the fatigue and other symptoms (we went from walking 2 miles a day before the stroke to a little over half a mile, my dad was really unhealthy before and this has been a long term project to get him get healthier) and finally, what is the potential for switching careers, especially post-stroke at 60 years old? He's worked with cars his whole life but has had a major interest in computers and even majored in system administration, just was never able to get a job in our area (it's pretty rural). I've gotten him working through a couple of UDemy courses updating his computer knowledge to the current tech and we've been looking at maybe starting his own business or getting a job telecommuting, but I'm wondering what other peoples experience has been working post-stroke.

It‚Äôs been a year at the new job and I love it so much. It has nothing to do with my degree or experience. I never knew you could work a full time job and lead a balanced life. Kudos to my employer for really caring about employees.\nSide note: I had a few interviews after quitting my retail job and when they all asked ‚Äúwhy are you switching careers‚Äù the companies that I told ‚Äúoh I had a stroke and I am looking for something less physically demanding Yada yada‚Äù did not offer me a position. The companies that I did not bring the stroke up to and just basically said ‚ÄúI am looking to learn something new‚Äù all offered me positions.\nSo my advise don‚Äôt bring up the stroke in an interview as for my personal experience it seemed to be the main reason they didn‚Äôt give me an offer.', ""I can't answer questions about working as I'm still off work after my stroke.

I just never know when the fatigue is going to hit.\n\nAs for the tingling, he can talk with his physician about it. There are medications that can help.

He has a whole new body and brain and whatever skills he built up over the years now have to be filtered through it. The fatigue and other damage make these types of discussions very frustrating for me- I have no idea when and if I‚Äôll heal up enough to work again, and what parts of my brain and body will even be viable. If anything, encourage him to daydream regularly and imagine the things he‚Äôs always wanted to do.

I could see that a lot of them really didn\'t care what any of the doctors, nurses, and therapists said or did, they just wanted to be left alone to die.\n\nIf your grandfather medically makes enough of a recovery to become well, his attitude toward recovery will then dictate how well he can become. You and the family should make your wishes known to him when he is ready to understand it - if you want him to decide for himself what he wants to do, tell him, but be aware that he may decide he doesn\'t care and wants to just close his eyes and sleep the rest of his life away. If you want him to recover as well as he can and live, tell him that and encourage him to fight for it.']",763

My mom also naturally has low blood pressure so her BP is kept up with medication. She is very weak and thin. 

We were told that they would not have independence, and recovery is slim. 

But my mom is getting stronger everyday. She is breathing at 80%, she is opening her eyes and seems to understand us. She is able to vary grip strength in her hand. When I tell her that I‚Äôm moving closer to home, she reacted strongly and gripped my hand firmly. Not like a firm handshake but former than she has been able to.

I\'d want to know the results from a consciousness assessment (like the Glasgow Coma Scale).  If multiple assessments were given over time,  I\'d want to look for trends.  For that matter,  I\'d want to go over test results in multiple areas that show trends (or lack thereof).   I\'d ask what things would indicate pain or discomfort and look for those.  I\'d want to discuss things I see as evidence of consciousness and know how accurate those impressions are (some reflexes seem like communication.  Some indicators of consciousness could be missed if you don\'t know what to look for. )   I\'d love to have an fMRI that looks at response to stimulus,  but that\'s getting fancy,  most likely.  I\'d want the doctors to give me concrete reasons for their prognosis. I\'d want to know best and worst case scenarios.   Most of all,  I\'d want to think about what my family member wanted.

I did have pain from various treatments. Sometimes significant pain.   During recovery I was very scared at times.  All my strokes were relatively minor and I had close to 100% recovery.   \n  \nHaving strokes and ensuing poor health from other conditions,  I have better defined wishes if I had a major stroke or brain damage.   I would probably want to be kept alive if there was a chance at meaningful levels of consciousness (and no intractable pain or discomfort).  For me that is being able to communicate wants and needs and discomfort, being able to have higher level interpersonal interaction (smile at person = not enough,  ""how was your day"" ""what are your plans"" ""do you remember when"" = maybe enough), and being able to meaningfully participate in things I enjoy.   Probably my minimum requirement for cognitive function would be similar to early stages of dementia.     If I had potential for this level of consciousness but wasn\'t there yet and I was otherwise stable,  I\'d want a few months to recover and see how I do.

772,My mom has been through multiple strokes.,9,d91qzd,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/d91qzd/my_mom_has_been_through_multiple_strokes/,14,"Hi, Reddit.

&#x200B;

I don't know where else to seek comfort or advise. So I have a post right here just to share and this is my mom's story.

&#x200B;

My mom was a gym instructor. At age 39, she had a stroke that affected the left side of her body. I was 13 years old back then. The reason for the clotted vein on her brain was through blunt force trauma which I presume was from my abusive dad.

&#x200B;

She went through rehab and was able to recover like maybe 60% and that was the last time I heard of my dad supporting her.

&#x200B;

I was young so I had to stick with my dad. I left my mom and older brother for school which I did not do good at. Well, I never went to college even when I was given money by my dad for it. Fast forward-- my dad stopped supporting me when I hit legal age, 18. So I had to work and get back home to support my mom through the money I make off being a call center agent.

&#x200B;

Here is a list of my mom's stroke incidents

39 yrs old -  affected left side (recovered a little due to rehabilitation and therapy)

40 yrs old -  affected left side (no therapy and rehabilitation)

42 yrs old -  affected left side (no therapy and rehabilitation)

45 yrs old -  affected left side (no therapy and rehabilitation)

49 yrs old - affected right side (she is now bedridden)

&#x200B;

Due to multiple strokes that affected the left side of her body, all that was carrying her through and giving her the ability to walk is her ""unstroked"" right side. But when she hit 49, she got hit on her right side and everything went down from there.

&#x200B;

No support from our relatives and anyone else except me and my brother. Yet my mother is still alive and she is turning 52 next month.

&#x200B;

Just this year though, she was admitted for a few times already. 5-6 times for TIA. She was vomiting nonstop until we get her to the ER and intra venous medication is provided to stop the vomiting.

&#x200B;

Until now, she still keeps vomiting mostly at night or after she eats. We do not know for certain as to why this happens and medical examinations does not show any symptom for the vomiting which means it is directly related to the multiple strokes due to clotting on numerous parts of the brain.

&#x200B;

Have you guys been in this situation? How should we care for our bedridden mom?

&#x200B;

PS

She blind for 3 years now due to diabetes.

779,Interruption to 15 Lessons in 42 Days: Daddy Had a Stroke,9,borwy3,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/borwy3/interruption_to_15_lessons_in_42_days_daddy_had_a/,4,"  

Friday, I planned to publish the second lesson of the blog series, 15 Lessons in 43 Days. For new readers who are unaware and for established readers who may have forgotten, I share how this series developed. On September 29, 2018 my 33-year old daughter had a stroke; after 7 months, I decided to share stories of the lessons learned during her recovery. However, on Wednesday last week, my father had a stroke. Now I sit beside his bed, in the same hospital just doors down from where my daughter, Kari, laid. 

I do not know if I am less emotional because experience taught me what to expect or because my body is numb. Either way I am here in the same setting, with many of the same characters, living a story that is very different. Writing flows from a new perspective. There has been no time for reflection so the words are raw. This is not a polished story with carefully chosen vocabulary, developed metaphors, or a huge amount of attention to grammar. I am simply sharing life as it happens.

Daddy‚Äôs stroke was not his first, but I fear it will impact his life more than any prior health event. On Wednesday, I planned to go with him to a doctor‚Äôs appointment. When I arrived at his house, he was sleeping in the recliner but woke to the noise. The moment he opened his eyes, his caretaker and I acknowledged something was wrong: his words were slurred, blood pressure high ‚Äì 247/130 ‚Äì really high, and his eyes were vacant.

It took longer than I wanted for the ambulance to arrive but then teleportation machines are not working on our planet - yet. 

The hospital staff followed the practiced maneuvers that to my eye appeared relaxed and unhurried. Nobody rushed from room to room. Nobody yelled, ‚ÄúStat!‚Äù Their bodies moved in slow motion nothing like what I had seen on ‚ÄúGrey‚Äôs Anatomy‚Äù, reminding me TV is fiction. Once it was confirmed that he had a brain bleed, they decided to transport him from Fruitland, ID to Boise. We discussed choices and made the necessary phone calls. 

Unclear about when the terminology changed, he became a stroke victim in ICU, hooked to tubes, wires, monitors. 

Now as I sit beside Dad‚Äôs bed, (he‚Äôs snoring quite loudly which must be a good sign), I realize strokes are not all the same. The body and mind of a 33-year-old handles a stroke differently than that of a 84-year-old. As I confided my thoughts and emotions with a friend, I felt like this was a whole new experience that I had to relearn even as my limbs performed the same tasks. She said, ‚ÄúMaybe this isn‚Äôt your lesson to learn.‚Äù

Luckily she was sitting in the ER when it happened but they thought she might have additional bleeding in her brain so she only received a little more than half a dose of altipase. Luckily the followup MRI showed that the bleeding was just contrast solution but at that point we were out of the window of treatment to finish the altipase.  She has right side paralysis and speech difficulties. She is extremely independent and was a nurse before the stroke. She passed her swallow test and from Tuesday until today she has gone from ER to neuro ICU to regular neuro and now today she has been moved to an outpatient rehabilitation center. I feel like I am 90% strength and 10% tears at this point, though some days the balance changes. She seems to understand what is being said to her and can answer yes or no questions with a little thought. I can see that she is frustrated that she can't find the words to fully express herself but I keep telling her that it is still really early in this process. Hard work and determination have never been an issue for her and I know she is in the right place to move forward.

I guess I'm just looking for some encouraging words. I know no one can tell me what recovery for her will look like but I was just interested in hearing about what a family member can do that is helpful (if you are a stroke survivor) and what has been helpful for families of stroke victims going through this, if that makes sense.  Any advice or personal stories are appreciated. I have been reading this subreddit a little already and look forward to being able to lean on the community a little bit as my family goes through this. 


I did have a few questions as well...my mom seems to have a lot of sensitivity to light, did anyone else experience this? Did it get better with time? Also, she is pretty sleepy though she seems to have more energy every day, even if just a little. Does the energy come back with time as well?

785,My Story,9,arp8v7,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/arp8v7/my_story/,3,"This seems to be the best place I've found to write any of this. So here goes. This is my story of surviving a stroke. I haven't thought this through, and so it will most likely just read as ramblings. I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing it here, other than it feels like I still want to get it out after months and it feels like I'm bothering friends and family if I keep mentioning it.

I am 31M and had a stroke the Monday after Thanksgiving last year. Ever since I was in middle school, I had always cracked my neck many times every day. I always just did it as a stress relief. I will never do it again. As it turns out ""neck manipulation"", as the doctors called it (yes, even from chiropractors, don't let them adjust your neck; ER doctor said most of the times he sees them it's from chiropractic patients), can cause an arterial dissection in your vertebral arteries. That dissection makes a pinch in the artery that causes turbulent blood flow which can create blood clots or pinch off the artery all together if it's severe enough. The MRIs confirmed this is what happened to me, or rather what I did to myself.

As it turns out, I am one of the lucky ones. It so happens that the artery I dissected is not the dominant side, my other is about 5 times the size. Even so, the literature I've read since indicates that only about 40% of victims of ischemic stroke due to vertebral arterial dissections fully or nearly fully recover with no deficits (loss of functions). Happily, I am in that 40%. Another 40% suffer significant deficits affecting quality of life, while 10% suffer severe deficits and require dependent care. The remaining 10% die in the acute stage of the stroke.

It's funny, I was explaining those odds to one of my friends over the phone as I was recovering; and while I was saying it I pulled up a random.org page to see how lucky I would get on that roll. A 1-4 was safe, a 5-8 was alive but not quite so good, a 9 was alive but only just, and a 10 was dead. I rolled a 10. She kept talking, but I don't know about what. I just sat there staring at the screen with the realization that if that had been my real roll of the dice, if that day had been the day I had a stroke as opposed to when I did and that been my result, that would've been it for me. Lights out, gone.

Now I can more or less get along life, though I certainly don't have near the energy I used to. I feel guilty on two fronts: one I feel like I can't give as much time and energy to my friends and family as before, and two that I'm not making the most of my good fortune and in some way I owe it to all those 60% of victims of the same thing as me that had a much worse result.

791,Post-Stroke Struggles/Rant,10,8da7ju,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/8da7ju/poststroke_strugglesrant/,8,"I had my cerebral hemorrhage stroke back in July 2017 in the right side of the brain while at work. My boyfriend at the time went looking for me since I wasn't responding to his texts or calls. I ended up having brain surgery and an emergency craniotomy that night. I lost all left side feeling and movement. I learned how to walk again, and went to a renowned rehab hospital in Colorado, called Craig Hospital. I was there for 30 days as inpatient and then another 4 months for outpatient rehab. As for work, I went on Short Term Disability, since I obviously was bed bound and doing rehab. I didn't really like the job and because I couldn't drive (It was a 45 minute commute) I started looking for other jobs that I could take the light rail to and a job that I enjoyed. I was able to find one within 2 weeks of putting my 2 weeks in at old job after the Short Term Disability ended. Luckily, they were extremely supportive as this stroke was a complete surprise to everyone. I was a healthy 29 year old who suffered this unfortunate medical crisis. Andddd it happened at work as I was working the later shift as a team lead of the call center. All of a sudden the next day, I am not there and my old coworkers were trying to get a hold of my supervisor to see about my whereabouts. It was a sudden incident that caught everyone off guard. like yes, I almost died. Yes, I had brain surgery. Yes, I got transported to the ER via an ambo at 11pm from the work building. I was supposed to get off at 630pm. It sucked. I'm still trying to to recovery from the damage that brain bleed did on my right side, which effects things like my problem solving and executive functions. I am not as fast in terms of learning new skills. I told the new job about my issues in the interview. I knew I would have issues learning the new things and the fast pace that the role required though. Having a TBI and the effects of it is not easy to explain to people who are unaware. I have zero control of what my brain does. I wish I could go back to normal and have the sense of urgency and speed like I had in my other jobs where i've excelled. But now I am just slower. With the stroke, I was on meds for seizures. I didn't have one though until late January when I started to slowly taper off them cause i didn't need them anymore. AND THEN come late March, I had another 2 seizures. With all those, I had to increase my anti-seizure meds which makes this girl very very sleepy and groggy.  Per the forums online, Keppra has that side effect, which sucks. But yea, either way I've been struggling with all this change. I've been trying to do well at the new job I had since October but I knew I wasn't performing as well as the other people in terms of quotas. So when they let me go this past Tuesday, I wasn't super surprised but I was extremely sad. Since this stroke back almost 9 months ago, I have lost my boyfriend, my freedom, my streak of being healthy as a horse for 29 years (no appointments ever necessary) my sense of security ( a seizure can happen at any time apparently) my family all moved back to colorado from california to take care of me and I'm super grateful for that but it just means they now take control of everything I do. I can't do really anything b/c of my health. I just turned 30 and just lost my job and now I am not sure how much more I can take. My health insurance ends the end of April and then who knows? I can't drive til late June due to my seizures. And due to my blood clotting disorder, I can't have any BCP in my life. and no alcohol consumption. so yes, my life as a 30 year old is not fun right now. I need to look for jobs where my brain damage won't effect my work performance. Heath insurance is quite expensive on COBRA. I really just want my old life back. I am alive but good god, life is hard now.            ",2018-04-18 23:30:07+00:00,"['I had a bleed (subarachnoid haemorrhage from right main cerebral artery aneurysm) in July 2015.

There‚Äôs barely a minute goes by I don‚Äôt think about what I miss of my old life. That said I do try as best I can to look to the future with optimism and hope. Physio is progressing (slowly but surely), I have a new house  to eventually move to, my girlfriend and our son are already there, he is happy and healthy having been raised by her alone the past few years. She has been amazing and they have been to see me every week since I was first hospitalised .

It‚Äôs easy to say all of that but there are days when I just  don‚Äôt give a fuck, as I‚Äôm sure you will understand. It‚Äôs just a case of not letting those emotions dominate.

792,6 months post stroke- my new normal?,9,7stjgy,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/7stjgy/6_months_post_stroke_my_new_normal/,11,"I'm 29 years old and I had my first stroke back in July. I had a hemorrhagic stroke and I had to have brain surgery. The brain bleed caused some chaos in my brain so they had to remove a part of my skull. They put me in medically induced acoma. This is started off with a very painful sharp headache behind my right eye. I had been getting these types of headaches often but I didn't think anything of it. Mind you, I'm a very healthy individual. Blood pressure/weight and everything was normal. They had to do many many tests to figure out what was going on. I have a blood clotting disorder, factor 8 apparently. No family history of this at all. I was the first one to have it. I had the surgery on a Thursday but I don't think I woke up and knew what was going on til Sunday. I was in the bathroom of my work, throwing up. I was supposed to meet my boyfriend at the time for pizza and a work out session at the gym. He was a bit of a jealous boyfriend, so when I didn't answer he started flipping out. He called me 99 times and sent many texts. I looked at them weeks later and he was pissed because I wasn't answering. The last couple of texts were him getting worried and saying he was gonna reach out to my sisters to figure out where I was. He contacted my good friend, Rachel and as well as my older sister. They began the search by ""pinging"" my phone. I was at work, the pinging location thing was saying i was in a random building somewhere. Luckily, Rachel was a former co-worker of mine so she knew where to find me. I spend 4 or 5 hours in the bathroom apparently. I had no idea. fast-forward to now, boyfriend left me because i was too focused on my recovery and my family hated him because of what he had said in the hospital.I'm not too sure why they hated him. They are very judgmental people. I loved him and he loved me through out the 8 weeks of hospital/rehab life. and now I am alone. Oh and I had a seizure a couple weeks ago so I can't drive for 3 months. I am slower at learning new things due to my injury and very easily triggered to sadness and agitation. I'm 29 years old and I'm living with my parents again. They were living in CA and now they moved back to make sure I'm safe. But living with them, makes my living like a normal 29 year old impossible. Before the stroke, Robert would come over after work.  And we would have fun. Now he nor anybody else can do that. I feel i am 16 years old again. No boyfriends allowed. Also, I had to get off birth control and overtime I would spend the night post stroke at robert's house. my mother would always say I had to be careful as pregnancy would kill me. But I was fine. I am 29 years old. I can have sexual encounters if i want to. They didnt like him but I loved him and now he's gone with another girl who happened to be a nurse. Robert wanted to spend his life with me and now thats not possible because my family doesn't care that I loved him and he supported me through my mood swings post stroke. I usually cry a couple times a week because he's gone and no-one else will love me or wants to be a 29 year old post stroke. I'm extremely lost and heartbroken. I've been told I should talk to a counselor but why? They will just tell me what a book would tell me. This is actually my life that I have to live everyday. I'm terribly depressed and he is with a new girl who is younger, skinny, and prettier than me. All I ever wanted was him but my family's hatred for him got in the way. And now I have to pay the consequences of this all. alone and still trying to figure out my new normal everyday.  Sometimes, I just wish I had crossed the bridge. When my mom told me she had my last rites given to me, I was mad that I survived. I just want to be happy and be loved by someone. If I continue on this past, I will die alone and depressed.

The things that helped me most were rest, counseling, and reading. You've been through something really tough. And I'm glad you made it through, so I really think you need to cut yourself some slack, and rest and recover. Counseling can be very helpful. It helps to just be able to talk about the things that are bothering you, and not just with a friend or family member. The counselor is an unbiased party who can be there to listen and to provide support if you need it. I went to a few different counselors before I found one that I really clicked with. After my second stroke, I had some vision loss which made reading very difficult. I spent a lot of time laying on the couch at my parents' house reading, and I think that helped make it easier. It was hard, and I had to go slow and sometimes use a bookmark to cover the page under the line I was reading, but I got better at it again. I had to relearn other daily tasks as well. Cooking was a challenge. I struggled with timing and knowing what to do first. I had to slow down, think through the other of the tasks I was doing, and re-teach myself things that had been second nature before. It took time, and practice. \n\nIt can be very hard for other people to understand what you're going through. For the most part, they won't unless they've been through it themselves. I lost friends.

There will be a new normal, but it won't be what you're dealing with right now. Give it time, and you'll have your life back. It won't be the same as it was before, it'll just be different. I really hope you can learn to see your own self worth. You don't need a boyfriend in order to be worthy of happiness.

795,My wife's stroke at 28 years old,10,5rvbct,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/5rvbct/my_wifes_stroke_at_28_years_old/,8,Ok so on January 6th my wife was put into ICU for a stroke that was caused by a disection of her vessel in the back of her brain. After a few days they had to operate on her brain and remove part of the cerebellum. She also had to have a stint put into her vessel to try and save it. She's currently responding to commands but is still on a ventilator. We are currently waiting on a rehabilitation center to have an open bed. I have no idea what our kids or myself are gonna have to do to help her when she comes home. Anyone have any advice/ similar stories that might help? Thanks in advance ,2017-02-03 17:39:31+00:00,"[""Any way you look at it you are in a tough position. My sympathy to both your wife and you. Best wishes for you all. \n\nHere are some thoughts based on my somewhat similar experience. \n\nRight now you have to oversee your wife's care. You need to understand what is being done for her and why. Try to understand her needs. Not just what the doctors say or even what she says but also what you observe and your own judgement. Don't just accept what the doctors say. Understand it and apply your own independent thought and judgement. \n\nGet family and trusted friends to help with the kids. (I assume they are young. ) Spend what time you can with them but near term your wife's needs are more important. Doing the right thing for your wife in the next few weeks can pay huge dividends for years. Assuming good family and friends your kids will get by without your undivided attention for a few weeks. \n\nRecognize that this is likely to be a marathon rather than a sprint. Yes for the next few weeks you will have to go flat out but try to give yourself a break for a couple of hours when you can. The longer this goes on the more important such breaks will be. Long term you must take care of yourself first. If you breakdown you can't do anything for your wife or kids. Don't be afraid to ask for help. \n\nKeep up to date on what the future plans are for your wife. Are they thinking to transfer her to a rehab hospital in a month or send her home in two days. ( That's the one that blindsided me. ) Find experts that can help you with financial and other resources. If you are in the US this is critical. Social workers frequently know how to make the system work. You won't have the time to figure it out for yourself. \n\nAs soon as they even whisper about your wife coming home find out in detail what kind of care she will need. Likely you can't provide all that care yourself and especially not take care of the kids too. Get help. Make sure all the resources are in place well before she comes home. I was totally unprepared when they sent my wife home. It was a disaster. \n\nBest wishes. "", 'I\'ll try to make this short because it has been a long and continuing journey. My husband at 49 had a massive bledding stroke on 1/4/16. He was not responding to commands and basically in a coma for a few months. They had to remove a piece of his skull to reduce swelling and the risk of perimnant  damage. Then he was transferred to a crappy long term hospital to continue recovery and basically wait for the swelling to go down before he was transferred back to have the skill bone put back in. (Had a shunt put in too btw) he then whent  to skilled nursing to get off the wedding tube and ventilator and then finally inpatient physical therapy. He finally came home 9/16 ane he continues physical therapy. Hes gone from coma, not talking, not moving to talking moving sitting up and now walking with assistance. He still has a long way to go but he\'s made tremendous progress. It sounds like your wife is farther along which is wonderful but this kind of recovery fortunately IS a marathon and not a spring. It moves at a frustratingly slow pace but it does move. I\'m lucky in that we don\'t have kids but it\'s taken all my education and strength to not go off the rails during this process. Here my advice to you:\n1. While she is under the care of the hospital (or any other facility you feel is doing a competent job) take time to take care of yourself and your kids. The first night he was in the neuro ICU an amazing nurse said to me ""be here when the docs make their rounds. Ask questions but don\'t sit and watch him. You will really need your energy when he stars moving and really getting into physical therapy"" and that was the best advice I got. \n2. Advocate the f out of your wife\'s needs. Ask questions, demand care and be obnoxious especially if you feel like they\'re giving her the brush off. Not all facilities are the same so check them out and trust your gut if it feels like the nurses are too overwhelmed or understaffed to pay proper attention to her, they will. So push for her to be transferred somewhere else if you can. Sometimes it may not be possible due to insurence BS. \n4. If the doctors aren\'t worried, don\'t be discouraged or freakout when she does weird things or seems like she\'s regressed. Recoverint from a brain injury is different from other injuries. The body will do weird things she may say or behave weirdly. It\'s just how it goes. \n3. Take a deep breath. A lot. All the time and just focus on the current task at hand. That will stop you from being overwhelmed. Do things that relax you. Wear clothes that are comfortable. Avoid friends that are draining. In short do what you need to do to take care of YOU. \n4. Ask for and accept help from friends/ family. You will need it in order to not get burnt out. (But.you probably will get burnt out. Thats ok. It\'s a lot)\n5. As soon as she gets transferred to a facility, Ask about up coming steps because when an insurence company decides that they are legally free and clear and can push your wife to a cheaper level of care they will do it. Asap. Not in a week. Even on weekends. So ask how long the place ask coverage and when they will notify you if she\'s being discharged. \n6. If you have the means check on Amazon for medical things she may need (wheelchair, arm support, hygiene products etc) a lot of medical things are available on Amazon and way cheaper than medical supply places and you don\'t have to wait for red tape and paperwork. If you have Amazon prime most of it can ship free which is great for heavy things. \n7. Don\'t let her get discharged and give into being tired. She will probably be tired a lot. If I hadn\'t  forced and fought and pushed and yelled at my husband when he wanted to quit he wouldn\'t be half of where he is now. \n8. Make a big deal about all and any positive steps because they tend to forget (maybe because of genuine memory damage and maybe because they are in it Evey day and they don\'t see the bigger picture). Remind her of what she couldn\'t do a week ago and what she can do now. \n9. Look into financial support like medical, disability ECT. If the hospital she\'s at has a social worker they may know or they may be useless and you have to do your own research. \n10. Acknowledge that its a shitty ass shitty thing that happened to her and you and let yourself be upset when your have some time alone. \n\nIt does get better just not as fast as we would like. \nOk so I lied, I didn\'t keep it short. :) ', 'Hi, \n\nMy 85 year old grandmother suffered a stroke in October. She was very active and sharp prior to that. Initially the hospital was going to have her do a few days of rehabilitation and send her home. Even though evaluations showed she was not ready to leave the hospital kept trying to move her along. In her first four days in rehabilitation she received one session of therapy. Her stay ended up being over three months, as she suffered heart failure on one of her visits home and had to be fitted with a pacemaker. Since her return around Christmas, she has showed improvement in memory, motor skills and speech. My advice based on my experience is to be patient with her, take time to tend to yourself, and make sure the hospital is being thorough and not hurrying her out the door. Once she returns, she may not remember words or past events. She will need lots of rest. Her personality may change. My experience is limited (not complaining, one person was enough) but I thought I would share anyways. I wish your wife a quick and full recovery, and all the best to your family during this difficult time.', '[deleted]', ""Before my stroke, I was a caregiver for my family.  My ex-wife couldn't handled my frailty and couldn't handled my kids.  I  had severe right-sided paralysis and I was mute.

She needs rest and rest and...  rest.  Get some caregivers to help you and your kids.  "", ""I can tell you visitors were the best part of my day, without them I doubt I'd have remained sane, Its a scary lonely experience.\n\nThe hard part is being encouraging without being annoying  imo because when you are going through recovery a full recovery seems as likely as  finishing a marathon crawling.\nWhat helped me personally the most (and still does) Is keeping in mind that I dont know where I'll be 6 months from now. I'd advise to help frame improvement by looking back 3 months and then project three months out, Its imperfect but better than getting distracted by current limitations. It may not seem like it to her but things do get better, and that is very hard to believe sometimes.\n\nBest of luck to you and your family.""]",796

Every day he spends his time googling how to solve his issues which is the worst thing to do and it feels like every month he adds another pill or supplement to his daily regimen. 

To go along with all of his physical issues, a lot of change has happened over these past four years and he is struggling to handle all of it. His wife left him, he is soon to be moving out of his house that he has lived in for 18 years and he was forced to retire from a job that he loved.

He tries all sorts of wild supplements, searches youtube videos for answers and gets distracted in PT/OT maintenance therapy very easily. He had a fall last year where we got a change in behavior that coincided: over the next 8 months his appetite died off and some behavioral things (paranoia,, stubbornness, a rise in impulsivity) all grew to a head. We reached out to his neurologist who referred him to followup neuropsych testing and an MRI.  \n\n\nDad's damage to his R hemisphere finally settled in since 2017 and he's essentially missing that side of his brain, down to what they call the midbrain. He's also tested as having Vascular Dementia - which was suspected by us but is now confirmed. 20% of stroke patients tend to find themselves on that path, especially if they had a massive stroke like my Dad had.  \n\n\nAll this to say - if your Dad is agreeable to it, get him in to see his neurologist. Mention the life changes he is undergoing ,the clinging to hope that a regime or pill will reverse his situation, and take note of anything else that kinda seems different. See if the neuro would be willing to refer him to a neuropsych test to see where his abilities fall both cognitively and behaviorally. If they find a deficit, they will be able to target treatment better (brain chemicals change with brain damage and levels can be adjusted when they have something to go off of) and they might also refer him to some counseling to deal with everything that has just happened.  \n\n\nFor the average person, those are big changes. For someone like our Dads, it can be insurmountable. This doesn't fall on you to solve, but you can help point him in the right direction with getting help. Also - you made progress with your Dad.

update: he's out of surgery. It was a ""medium stroke"" that occurred because he had a tear in the inner lining(s) of his carotid artery which produced a clot, and then that caused a stroke.

Memory loss and confusion, especially. He would forget the names of basic things like cups and tables, lose track of what he's trying to say/do very often, and can't use his smartphone anymore.  He would be confused between his own children, too.

I had a speech therapist coming around my flat for some months help me train up my language. I had to ""find"" words again and sometimes it took some weeks before they got rooted in my memory again.\n\nFor me it was all about what was in the front of my memory and not. Also some things we tend to associate to other stuff. For instance, when she showed me a pictures of an octopus I couldn\'t remember the word for it so I told her that I didn\'t but I\'d like to say ""chtuhlu"" and then explained to her what chtuhlu is and then I remembered octopus (chtuhlu is part of the horror author H.P Lovecrafts creations, an elder god that baring resemblance to an octopus) but I used the word more often then octopus and therefor wanted to call it chtuhlu  and by doing it I remembered octopus. My husband was very proud of me though, to remember chtuhlu atleast!\n\nYour friends language will should get better with time, mine did. One thing the therapist told me that when I couldn\'t remember a word my husband shouldn\'t tell me the word but give me hints so help my brain to try to remember it.\n\nMy language is good now (7 years since my stroke) but I still suffer from aphasia every now and then and then my language suffers and I will have some minor problems finding some words.\n\nI wish your friend all the best in his recovery!', 'Yes, and it potentially can with help! I saw that they refuse to go to therapy, if they are older and have medicare that should cover home health after stroke if their primary doctor orders it. Im not sure about other insurances. They should be able to do speech therapy and can help with language processing in home. I also recommend seeing an eye doctor, after my husbands strokes he was diagnosed with macular degeneration. Im not entirely sure if that is what caused it, but our eye doctor said it was likely the cause. If you cant get at home therapy and they absolutely refuse to go, try doing things at home that involve word recall and and sentence building. I do these with my husband daily and it has significantly improved his symptoms. It can be simple things like asking them to name simple objects like pillows or pens, and moving up in difficultly as it becomes easier, or having them complete phrases like ""king and ___ (queen)"" or ""we open the ___ (door)"" some of them have multiple answers which can take the burden off remembering very specific words. We also did picture identification and sequencing (using sequencing cards specifically made for that) directly after the stroke, and the more we did it he started to be able to memorize them. These are exercises our speech pathologist did with us, so they may not be as effective for your loved one but it may potentially help if they refuse treatment or evaluation. Keep in mind it can be very frustrating for them and to be extremely patient if you try to help them yourself. Someone else suggested giving hints and we do this too. Depending on the severity of the stroke and where it affected, it may take a very long time to see a lot of improvement, and thats okay. When we first started using our language processing book the speech therapist lent us, my husband could not get past the first exercise, but several months later he can do 20-30 pages fairly well (excluding some of the more obscure questions, my general rule for asking them is if i cant get it pretty easily i dont ask him lol, and sometimes he has a bit of regression or bad day and we have to slow down on them), and using the book makes it easy to track progress. She also recommended using labeled/really clear pictures when possible, and things like white boards to easily write things down and erase. Also, if they like reading a newspaper subscription could maybe help with orientation. It may also benefit them to see a neurologist if you havent yet and can afford/access one. Anyway, i wish you all the best and hope they will agree to let you help them. Remember it is their decision as long as they are competent to make medical decisions and understand the potential consequences of not seeking help, which can unfortunately involve losing a lot of independence. And lastly, sorry to make this so long, but multiple choice questions seem to help my husband a lot when he cannot recall words. Instead of ""what do you want for dinner?"" i might ask ""do you want a hamburger or seafood?"" and if he doesnt want either i can come up with new options. This works for a lot of things but not all, as most treatments for things do.', ""Yes while this common, some of it returns, some may take longer.

808,My Dad Had a Hemorrhagic Stroke,7,px5guk,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/px5guk/my_dad_had_a_hemorrhagic_stroke/,11,"Last Tuesday I got a call from the hospital stating my dad had a brain aneurysm resulting in a Hemorrhagic Stroke. When he got to the hospital he was very confused, and vomiting. This all stretches back to him having high blood pressure and believing only taking vitamins and supplements would fix him. Never went to get regular check ups, etc. 

He was at work at work when it happened. Walking around and boom, aneurysm. They rushed him to the hospital as fast as they could, but the one they rushed him to couldn't operate on him. Around 2 hours later, they got him transferred to a different hospital. They weren't able to operate on him for 12 hours after transfer due to his high blood pressure.

Wednesday they did the surgery, and got him under control with a stint in place. Not much progress has been made, but I understand it's a long road to recovery... If at all. His swelling hasn't come down as fast as they'd hoped, he's got a fever, and had issues with his kidneys this Saturday. 

Idk what to do. There isn't anything I can do. My sister's in Japan, my dad's wife and I aren't on the best terms so it's a bit awkward, and we're so distant from my mom's side of the family I hate talking to them for support. I'm sorta just on my own. At least it feels that way. 

All I can do is hope he pulls through this. He wont have very much functionality, they think, especially the left side of his body thanks to the amount of blood present. It was a major vessel that burst on the right side of his brain, and they're still trying to get some of the blood out.

UPDATE 09/31/2021: Swelling has come down, fluid is mostly off of his brain, and his fever is coming down. They lowered his sedation, and he started wiggling his left leg again. He's still unconscious, but we're on the right track! He'll likely have some memory loss, though to what extent is unknown. Thank you all for your support. I really do appreciate it.

Everyone starts somewhere but I can tell you what I did. If you\'re able to visit him, try to visit him as often as possible or stay as long as you can and just talk to him and let him know that you\'re there even if it seems like they aren\'t even conscious because who knows they might be able to hear you and it helps to prevent delirium. Although, you should ask the nurses if it\'s ok to talk a lot because sometimes it could be bad to give him too much stimulation but it depends. You can tell him the time and date every time you come just in case he is listening and just tell him about normal stuff like what you did or see and just inform him of stuff outside the hospital. Sprinkle in a few positive things that has happened or some morale boosting stuff here and there. Just being there does a lot of things. \n\nI\'m not sure if you want to talk with your dad\'s wife but it could be beneficial to kind of communicate with her about what you think is best for your dad and what\'s the plan from here on out if she\'s going to be with your dad most of the time during his recovery.

Also, you can ask the nurse if there\'s any appropriate massages or exercises like lifting arms/legs you can do for him during your visit which can be a good head start to his recovery (might need a fact check here).

A TIA is also known as a **mini-stroke.** However, that name is very misleading.

During a TIA, a blood vessel blockage occurs temporarily in the brain due to a clot, but symptoms typically resolve. It‚Äôs still possible to have severe symptoms similar to having a full-blown stroke, but symptoms either don‚Äôt last or won‚Äôt be as severe when the clot clears.  
‚Äã  
Some people have no idea that they have had a TIA and only find out later after a full-blown stroke or head imaging. If you're aware of having a TIA, it‚Äôs really important to take it as a warning sign that a stroke may be in the future. While not every stroke can be prevented, up to 80% can be, according to the CDC!

Are they still healing or is this how it's going to stay? I mean, sometimes i have a few good days where nothing hurts and i'm starting to get hopeful and then the pain comes back, i have a week of terrible pain and misery that comes with it.

Kinesiology tape is a type of stretchy tape that can be applied to the areas of the body to reduce pain, encourage certain movements, provide support, reduce swelling, and increase mobility.

Kinesiology tape allows the wearer to put differing amounts of stretch through the tape depending on the type of result you're looking for. In terms of stroke recovery, kinesiology tape can be used in several different ways: to improve posture and balance, reduce shoulder subluxation, reduce pain, and reduce the effects of spasticity.

It's also something that can be used at home after instruction from a healthcare professional. If you do decide to use it, look out for bruising or skin irritation from the adhesive.

842,OT Tip: High Blood Pressure & Stroke Risk,8,mqqffq,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/mqqffq/ot_tip_high_blood_pressure_stroke_risk/,1,"On Monday, I talked about the 5 leading stroke risk factors: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, and diabetes.

But *why* do these put someone at a greater risk for stroke? Let's take a short deep dive into high blood pressure and stroke risk.

The fuss and hubbub around having high blood pressure are present for a reason. Chronically elevated blood pressure causes the walls of our arteries to weaken, narrow, and become damaged. This can cause a greater opportunity for a clot to form (leading to ischemic stroke) or a blood vessel to rupture (leading to a hemorrhagic stroke).

This also puts strain on the heart muscle. The heart has to pump more often and harder due to the need to push blood through the narrowed arteries.

Chronic high blood pressure is one of the primary causes of hemorrhagic strokes. While genetics and race/ethnicity (things you can't change) play a role in developing high blood pressure, there are still modifiable risk factors you can work on.

The biggest lifestyle factor to change is *diet:* particularly to cut back *sodium* in your diet.

**Why?**

At a chemical level, water always follows salt. When you over-consume salt, an excess amount of water follows that salt into your blood vessels. This extra fluid in your blood vessels causes increased blood pressure.

If you're thinking about changing your diet to decrease sodium intake, check out [the DASH diet](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456) or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension to get some ideas.",2021-04-14 13:20:18+00:00,['[deleted]'],843
843,OT Tip: The Top 5 Stroke Risk Factors,8,mpg8ug,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/mpg8ug/ot_tip_the_top_5_stroke_risk_factors/,0,"One in three people who have a TIA (transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke) will go on to have a stroke. [Half of those people will have a stroke](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20355679) within a year following the TIA.

The difference between a TIA and a full-blown stroke is that with a TIA, the clot clears, and symptoms resolve with few (if any) lingering issues. It's ""transient"" or passing.

I'm not saying this to scare anyone. It's necessary to educate ourselves and others to try and prevent the onset of stroke. If you've had a TIA or know someone who has, share that statistic.

Up to [80% of strokes in the U.S. are preventable](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/healthy_living.htm#:~:text=Stroke%20is%20preventable.,by%20making%20healthy%20lifestyle%20choices.). The 5 leading risk factors for stroke are:

1. Smoking
2. High blood pressure
3. High cholesterol
4. Diabetes
5. Obesity

A TIA, and even your first stroke, can serve as an opportunity to focus on lifestyle and medication to reduce the risk of having another stroke. Talk with your doctor to make sure you're on a medication regimen that helps control diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.

She had also lost the use of her complete right hand side, but has since regained full use apart from her right arm down to the finger tips, although this is showing improvement. We found out yesterday that she will be released from the rehab unit in 2 weeks! We are all so happy and inspired by the work and recovery she is making, however I understand there is a long road ahead and I want to be as fully prepared as I can be.

I will be her primary care giver, although she has a good circle of family and friends who have all agreed to help out in any way possible which is going to be a great help, we make a good team.

On a day to day basis, I will be going to work most days, 9-5, my partner will most days be dropped of with family at their home or at her family owned business, so she will be well watched and mentally nourished. 

Apart from rehab exercises, can anyone who's been in the same position give me ideas of things to do in our spare time, the aim of the game is a relaxed, humorous time where she can feel challenged.

I actually don‚Äôt use Reddit that much to post, mostly just a reader but happy to be here anyway!
But I wanted to see if any of you had similar experiences. 
My mom had a stroke roughly 3.5 weeks ago. She is back at home yet and honestly we were super fortunate with the size of her stroke that she bounced back as well as she did. She is still experiencing some pretty bad aphasia which seemed to be improving up until last night/today.

My mother (age 72) recently had an Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the blood cause a tumor-like pressure which resulted in intense pain a weakness on her left side. A CT scan showed that the bleeding had stopped and the doctor told us that once the blood was reabsorbed the pain would decrease, which it did, also her state of mind is back to normal in the sense that she can speak, keep a coherent conversation and remember events that occur in the day. 
However yesterday she started feeling weakness in her right side that today expanded into full body paralysis (she can barely keep her head straight). An MRI was performed and came back clear all that is left to do is wait a few more days in observation and then physical therapy.
I‚Äôm really concerned about the full body paralysis, since if the pressure was relieved how come the physical symptoms got worse? Has anybody gone thru something like this?

848,20M ischaemic stroke,8,m5etb0,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/m5etb0/20m_ischaemic_stroke/,9,"Just going to put my story out here, as it definitely helped me reading through everyone else‚Äôs while recovering. I had a small ischaemic stroke about a month ago now. When it happened I lost feeling in my right hand and was having trouble speaking. I wasn‚Äôt mute, but definitely stuttered almost every sentence and had significant brain fog. At the time I was pretty fit, had being doing about 60km of jogging a week, and got back from a long run a few hours before. I always ate well and don‚Äôt drink as much as most of my peers. 

When it happened I was lucky to be at home, so my parents knew something was wrong straightaway, although we weren‚Äôt sure what. In hindsight it was lucky we didn‚Äôt know speech was a symptom or we all would‚Äôve panicked. I guess I‚Äôd never really thought about the possibility of having a stroke being so young. We went up to emergency, but even then I sat there for a little while as I didn‚Äôt really think it was a total emergency.

Thankfully I got pushed through the formalities quickly and had the scans were done within about 90 minutes. By this point my speech was totally back, however I was still a little hazy. I had the thrombosis and thankfully there were no troubles there throughout the night. The MRI the next day showed some small areas of scarring in the parietal and frontal regions of my brain.

I was out of hospital 5 days later but back in the next week for a procedure on my heart (PFO closure - quite a common one here). I think being so young the likelihood of it being the cause gets pushed much higher. According to a table in a research paper I read in my case it was over 90% attributable as the cause.

Now a month removed I‚Äôm feeling a lot better. The brain fog and fatigue is gradually going away everyday. I guess because of the nature of my stroke (everyone‚Äôs own case is unique) rehab has naturally been more mental than physical. The biggest thing for me is the anxiety, which I‚Äôm learning to deal with. Meditation has helped me tremendously on a day to day basis.

While I am super fortunate to walk away almost unscathed, it also plays on my mind how I will have to be so careful going forward.

It's shocking when someone who was otherwise perfectly healthy has a stroke. I'm not sure what type of stroke your mom had or how severe it was, but I was 23 when I had two hemorrhagic strokes. I was perfectly healthy and they came right out of the blue. The doctors think it was just a fluke of genetics, and there wasn't much a way for them to have prevented or predicted that this would happen. And sometimes that's how these health issues are. You're fine until you're not. But that's not the thing I want you to focus on. I want you to look ahead. It's only been two months. For me it took more time than that to recover. I can't give you an exact timeline, but I can give you hope. It's been about 5 years now since mine happened, and I'm so so much better now. You wouldn't even know what happened to me unless I told you. Two months is still early days, and there is so much more improvement that can happen for your mom as more time passes. \n\nI don't want you to worry and stress every waking moment. It'll take time, but believe me it'll get better. You're having your eyes opened to something you couldn't even fathom before. You're probably learning so much more about strokes and risks and recovery and hospitals than you ever thought you would. It's a lot to take in, and nobody would be entirely calm having to deal with that. \n\nYou need to give yourself some breathing room. Take a walk if you can. Listen to some good music. Eat something you like. Watch a movie or a show, or read something you enjoy. At the very least set some time either each day or a few times a week where you can recharge. Self care is so important, even more so when you're dealing with something scary and stressful like this. Something else that also helps me a lot is writing in a journal. It helps me to be able to pour out all my thoughts and worries onto the page so I don't have to let them keep bouncing around inside my head. \n\nI really hope this helps you.

Our relationship has changed greatly due to the stroke and several other items.  All the doctors we have seen tell us that is very common for people to change due to the stroke and how much additional stress is put on all parties involved. Its very important to know that the body only has so much time to retrain itself to get back to ""normal"". I would recommend sticking to the normal lifestyle she had prior to stroke and physical and occupational therapy is very crucial.', 'I‚Äôm going to hop in your mom‚Äôs shoes here for a sec because I‚Äôm about her age and had a stroke last year even though I‚Äôm otherwise healthy. I have two kids myself and I‚Äôve watched them go through this with me. The anxiety you‚Äôre feeling is totally normal, and I think/hope it will lessen with time. However, I do have my teenager talking to a therapist because it‚Äôs always good to deal with our tough emotions rather than letting them fester and build - especially right now when the world is stressful enough anyway. If therapy is not your thing, consider journaling or other forms of relaxation and self care (meditation, exercise, etc.). Maybe you can even do something like this with your mom, because she‚Äôs probably anxious as well and it could actually be an important part of her recovery that you can participate in. \n\nPart of your worry may stem from unanswered questions about your mom‚Äôs stroke, recovery, and prognosis so a frank conversation with her might help as well.\n\nThe thing that I am most grateful for after my stroke is that I‚Äôm still here and able to hug my kids. I suspect she feels similar, and showing her how much you love her will probably mean the world - so be sure to love on her when you can!\n\nWith our young age and modern medicine, my doctor has given me every reason to feel hopeful about the future for people like your mom and I.', 'I‚Äôm sorry this has happened. I had a stroke recently and I completely understand the anxiety and the want to help prevent another. \n\nI‚Äôve mentioned this a few times to other people in similar situations but a smart watch has helped me immensely. They can monitor for irregular heart beats, perform an ecg and monitor O2 saturation. You can set emergency contacts so that if the owner calls emergency services it will alert the contacts with gps location. Some of them have fall detection that will call emergency services and alert you contacts. It‚Äôs helped me a lot and it‚Äôs helped people around me be a bit more comfortable. \n\nIf the doctors are happy with how your mom is progressing, as we‚Äôre mine. The only other controllable thing I could do was to evaluate my diet and exercise.

My grandad (78) had a stroke on Tuesday. My mother and I suspect he had a stroke around 2:30 - 5 (due to his internet history on his laptop, last activity was 2:30. We visited around 5:30) whilst he was downstairs. There were items all over the living room floor and the phone was knocked off. We think he somehow managed to navigate himself through the living room and up his stairs into his bed where he would have fell asleep. We found him in his bed upstairs and when I asked him if he was okay he was repeating a sentence over and over and wasn‚Äôt making sense. 999 asked us to check the temps of his chest and if he had any rashes which seemed fine and asked him to hold two arms in front of him. His left arm seemed pretty fine but his right arm looked weak and he struggled to lift it a bit. His face however looked normal, no drooping on the left or right. He seemed to understand me and he recognised me. I also managed to get out of him that he had also fell over because he had a red sore and small cut on his hand and elbow. They were also bruised. Prior to the ambulance coming he actually managed to turn him self out of bed and sit upright by himself (he needed the toilet, otherwise I would have told him to stay put until the ambulance came). When they arrived he was able to get down the stairs with assistance and sit him down on the couch downstairs whilst we put some clothes on him for getting in the ambulance. Whilst he was downstairs he actually spoke fairly well telling the doctors it was freezing (the door was open for the doctors) and if there was something to wear. On Wednesday the doctors confirmed it was a big stroke however he can eat unassisted, walk slowly with help, his speech is still not great but can get some words out but he is still confused.

***It‚Äôs fear. ‚Äã***‚Äã  


The more afraid you are of falling, the more likely you are to have a fall. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you should be cautious.

&#x200B;

**How can you balance a healthy level of fear with an unhealthy one?**‚Äã  


1. **Identify the situations which make you anxious about falling.** Do you get anxious in your own home, while out at the grocery store, or in crowded places? Think about some ways to reduce the likelihood of falling in these places. For example, clear clutter away from walkways in your home.
2. **Identify symptoms that make you anxious.** Do you have vision or balance issues that make you afraid of having a fall? Talk to your doctor about medications that might cause this and about any adaptive aids that could help you feel more confident.
3. **Use canes & walkers as prescribed by your doctor or therapist.** I know there‚Äôs a stigma around using devices like these, especially for young stroke survivors, but using assistive devices to walk with will provide you with greater stability.
4. **Exercise.** Keep your body strong. Try Yoga and Tai Chi which are both great to improve balance! They can be easily modified to be done sitting or standing.

short recap: Mom nearly died and had her left leg amputated above knee in may, then had a significant stroke in october that left her 99% paralyzed on left side along with moderate cognitive issues and minor non-genetic dementia. She's mostly bed ridden, cant control bowels, has a 10 minute attention span tops, losing weight because she wont cooperate with eating and losing weight, last check was 104lbs about 3 weeks ago, down from 130-140 before this mess started  


She left the hospital, went to an acute rehab facility for 3 weeks followed by a long term skilled nursing and rehab facility for 2 months. She was discharged from that location today and is now in a new long term skilled nursing facility but she's out of rehab days on Medicare. We are now operating under nursing home Medicaid  (not sure what you call it) so they're treating her like a permanent resident and not providing recovery rehab because of it.

From my understanding nursing home medicaid is for low income people that need permanent caregiving to live in a skilled nursing facility permanently. This isn't what we want, but it's the only option we have without paying the full total out of pocket (\~5k/mo). In order to continue her recovery rehab she will need to come home for 2-3 months so her rehab days reset, at which point she can go back to another rehab facility for up to 100 days

Our goals have been to get her to a stable enough point to bring her home and we do not have any interest in leaving her in a nursing home like this. Currently our plan is to have her there for a few days so we can lay out and prepare as best we can to bring her home, but I'm extremely concerned it wont' be a manageable situation

We have medicare A, B, and D. We missed the enrollment period for C (advantage plans) and from my understanding there's no exception to the enrollment period and we have to wait until next nov/dec to enroll, ie wait a year.  


I work full time and was going to school before this happened, took a semester off but need to get back into it because I'm already in my mid 30's and time is not on my side. I have a brother who can be with her during the day while I'm at work, but frankly hes got his own issues and is a much smaller person than me. While she was home before the stroke he became extremely overwhelmed having to manage our mom during the day and struggled to keep things going how they needed to. He's also not able to move our mom very well because of his size. With her being paralyzed + newly amputated leg our mom needs help with basically everything and it causes her to be an extreme fall risk, I also don't want him to get overwhelmed and start slacking and allow mom to backtrack even further as I don't think another incident is going to be something she can survive with her current state  


I need guidance, I don't know what to do. I want to continue moms rehabilitation and get her as far as she possibly can go and I want to bring her home, but our benefits are locked up and shes not yet in a manageable state to safely be home, suggestions?  


additional questions/advice wanted: I'm struggling to get mom to cooperate with eating, exercising, trying to do things on her own whatever little she can, etc. Shes also difficult to communicate with, in person she can hold a conversation fairly fine but she has random spurts of extreme confusion and wecan only hold her attention for 5-10 minutes in person and 1-2 minutes on the phone. She will literally stop paying attention while you're mid sentence and stare off into space, and for the last month she hangs up in less than 2 minutes when on the phone. She will literally call me, say hello and hang up in the middle of you responding.",2021-01-08 10:13:17+00:00,"['This is such a difficult situation.

**You Don‚Äôt Need Expensive Equipment to Improve Hand Function**

Using a combination of exercises and activities aimed at improving range of motion or strength is more effective than exercise alone. Research has proven this. A combination approach can also keep you from getting bored of the same exercises day in and day out.

**And it‚Äôs also a heck of a lot cheaper.** 

E-stim, robotics, virtual reality, and video games can all be great tools to use in recovery. But they can be expensive. You usually need guidance in how to safely use them or you need a doc‚Äôs approval.

Or get him a tablet/laptop to play on or similar.   \n3) Kinda stupid, but I would consider getting a pet, especially a dog. He needs to keep active once he is back at home. And he might need someone to take care of, so that he both ""feels useful"" and has someone depending on him, so that he can\'t give up.

So my dad had a stroke in September. He's now home, doing exercises and living as much of a normal life as he can currently. He's still very weak in his left.

I'm currently home to help with his recovery, we were given a booklet of info on how to care for him. Included was section on his diet, it's all the stuff you expect and he's really resistant to it, but he's not totally in a place to resist it. 

For instance he keeps wanting white bread but the house has switched to whole grain, especially since my mom has a heart problem and diabetes. But certain things have become upsetting to both him and I. 

His first night home he asked if he could have fried chicken. I was supremely uncomfortable with it, but he'd been in the hospital for so long that we called it a cheat day celebration for him and let him have it. Very weary of the  possibility that he may think he'd have his way all the time. 

The following night my mom let him have pork chops. Which REALLY annoyed me. A cheat day isn't a cheat day if it's every fucking day.

 The rest of the week I had control of the meals. Fed him not just in accordance with what is recommended.  


He feels like we're bullying him though. Like what he wants doesn't matter. And I understand his feelings must be something like ""I can't get up and do the things I want to do. And I can't even eat the things I want to eat.""   


So for the past four days he's been eating fine. And now it's friday and he's asking to have Chinese take out. And my mind set is, ""Fuck no. Dude you already had two cheat days this week."" He keeps saying he doesn't understand why he can't just have what he wants. And we keep explaining to him, you can't have salted crackers because of the sodium and your blood pressure! You can't eat much (if any) red meats because of cholesterol!  

The reason you got in this mess to begin with is these things!   


But I'm not a dietician... I've never had a stroke. Am I being to militant about his diet? And how do I make him care along with me for his dietary health?",2020-12-11 18:40:37+00:00,"['I\'m sorry, strokes and the fall out are so hard on every single little aspect! Daily my SO complains about the lack of white bread and all the treats he used to indulge in. He has such a sweet tooth and grew up in a household where red meat and potatoes was dinner almost every night. Basically, a horribly typical American diet\n\nIt\'s definitely been hard on many levels because food really represents so much more than just fuel for living. Sad? Have a cookie to feel better. Cranky? You\'re probably just hangry and need to eat. Celebrating? Let\'s go out to eat or have a piece is cake! Or, ""I\'m an adult so I can choose to eat what I want and deal with the consequences"". Food and having the fortune to choose what and when to eat is a powerful thing really. It\'s understandable that you dad is trying to exert independence with his food choices since having a stroke seems to limit EVERYTHING in your life.\n\nWhat helped my SO and I was to compromise. He still gets treats, like pb m&m\'s, but only a tiny bit. I purchased tiny condiment cups that hold two ounces each. He gets two of those a day with things like nuts, twizzler bites, m&m\'s, etc. This is not ideal but I\'m trying to be realistic also. \n\nI did have to get full of tough love at one point though and told him when he can get up, walk to the car, and drive himself, he can go eat whatever he likes but until then, if I\'m in charge of food, we were going to at least try to do better. Good luck to you!!!', 'I have a deep freeze in my kitchen.\n\nWhen I was i the hospital for stroke, my father had a fit about the fact that he found 5 frozen pizzas in my deep freeze, and went on and on and on at me about how I\'m diabetic and I should never under any circumstances be eating pizza.\n\nAs a stroke victim, it was very difficult for me to talk. What I wanted to tell him, but couldn\'t because I couldn\'t talk, was that yeah, I had pizzas in my deep freeze, and yeah, doctors say never to eat that, but they also advise that when my blood sugar is low I should eat something with sugar and/or carbs, and also those pizzas had been in my deep freeze for 6 months untouched because I only ate one when my blood sugar indicated that I needed to (or at least could). In other words, yeah, I had cheat food around, but I was being responsible about it. (In fact when you\'re diabetic you really should have some sugar and stuff that\'s bad for you around in case you need it because your meds make you trend toward having low blood sugar, which is much more immediately dangerous than high blood sugar. High blood sugar can put you in the hospital. Low blood sugar can put you in the morgue.)\n\nSo, what I\'m saying is, being a stroke victim can make it very frustrating when people want to tell you how you must behave (including eating) because sometimes you are actually being responsible and they\'re being irrational and you are unable to find the words to tell them why, and you\'re a fucking adult and someone is dictating to you what you may or may not do like you\'re a child.\n\nWhether you\'re right or wrong, telling him he can\'t have what he wants is you telling an adult man, who knows that he lived for decades under his own control and got married and had and raised a child and is theoretically not in jail, that he can\'t decide for himself what to put in his mouth. He feels like you\'re bullying him because you *are* bullying him. It\'s okay to recognize this fact (and even say ""yup, I\'m bullying you, because you need to eat healthy things or you\'ll have another stroke, so I\'m not giving you anything now but salad"") - just because you\'re bullying him for his own good doesn\'t mean it isn\'t happening. Whether you\'re right or wrong, you need to recognize that this undoubtedly offends him, and that the more often you tell him ""no"" the more often he wants to do it, either just to spite you or because it has become ""forbidden fruit"". I am not saying ""let him eat himself out"", I am saying ""this is the reason behind it, please try to be understanding.""', 'As a stroke survivor myself, you sound a bit militant.', ""What helped my dad was hearing it directly from the doctor. The doctor flat out let him know he should be on a very low sodium diet and provided a list of foods he should avoid. We went over everything together. He's also on  Warfarin which limits the type fruits and veggies he can have. Right now he's on such a strict diet he eats virtually the same thing every week. \n\nWe read the back of every packaged food/beverage before purchasing. He's allowed 600 mg sodium per meal 200mg per serving 2000mg per day. He's also on fluid restriction so he can only have 32-38oz per day. He's diabetic so carbs are closely monitored as well. I think having a doctor laying it out flat and bluntly should do the trick. My dad hates his diet but he eats it begrudgingly because he knows it's good for him. Sometimes it's more believable when coming from a professional."", 'Not a dietician either.

He was reaching up for something and felt a twinge in his neck. In the next few hours he started experiencing some pins and needles in his right arm. He still worked 9 hours after that happened. He had me take him to the hospital two days later when he was still experiencing the pins and needles in his right arm, shoulder, right side of his chest, and right side of his face. He was also having some back/neck pain and a headache. Those were his only symptoms. I honestly thought he had just pinched a nerve in his neck and was shocked when they said he had a stroke after doing a CT scan. I wasn‚Äôt able to be there because of Covid and I don‚Äôt think he totally understood what they said to him but this is what I understood from what he told
me. They suspect a blood vessel (i have no idea which one) was already weakened due to high blood pressure, and when he looked up at work it pinched the blood vessel causing it to burst causing bleeding. (which to me sounds like a hemorrhagic stroke). He was only in the hospital for 2 days and they did a ton of tests (including an mri), concluding he doesn‚Äôt need physical therapy of any kind, his eye sight wasn‚Äôt affected, and basically he just needs to lower his blood pressure with medication (they also have him on prescribed aspirin) and lifestyle changes. The blood vessel wasn‚Äôt repaired. They didn‚Äôt say where in his brain the stroke happened that he can remember. If he had a hemorrhagic stroke why wasn‚Äôt the blood vessel repaired? why did he only experience pins and needles that got worse over the course of 24 hours and then stayed that way, did the stroke stop itself? sorry i don‚Äôt understand how any of this works and wasn‚Äôt able to ask his doctor any questions.

When someone has a hemorrhagic stroke, the doctors want the blood to clot in order to prevent further brain damage. I had an ischemic stroke and currently take aspirin that way I won‚Äôt have another one. \nIf he had a hemorrhagic stroke, they would most likely preform surgery because those types of strokes are much more damaging than ischemic stroke. It kills off brain cells much, MUCH quicker. Since he was able to function for two days and the only symptoms he had were numbness/pins and needles and headache, I suspect not a lot of brain cells were damaged or only brain cells within one region were damaged. If it was a TIA (transient ischemic stroke aka ministroke), there is a very high possibility that another one may occur in the near future. Lifestyle changes and taking medication would be the best way to prevent this. \n\nWishing for the best for your dad!', ""I had a stroke about a year affecting my right side, I've regained full functionality of my right arm, but the right leg is little dead, and has foot drop.

Ischemic strokes often get worse over a couple of days as penumbral damage damage around the clot may kick in. If he's walking and talking without problems, no face droop or vision gaps, then it sounds like he is doing pretty well but I do encourage you to advocate for him and find out what is going on.  Does the hospital have a nurse line or ombudsman phone to get started asking questions?

He spent 2 weeks in intensive rehab but due to behavioral issues we had to have him transferred to another rehab. he spent a month there and made some recovery, but nausea and anger issues resulted in many missed meals and further weight loss. 

He was released at the end of September and has had nurses coming to the house for speech, PT, and OT for most of October, but they agreed he had made enough physical progress that he should be able to go out and do rehab at their facility rather than at home (for cost reasons too). 

Getting up and out of bed was always a 20-30 minute task, but since the last nurse left he has routinely refused to leave bed to the point of violence against me and my mother. He's missed medication for his heart, diabetes, and depression multiple times. We're having difficulty getting him to just take his nausea medication now (4 times a day) but since he keeps missing it he is back to where he was. As of today hes a day and a half without any medication aside from 1 Tigen that took 2 hours to convince him to take. He hasnt eaten since yesterday morning and has had very little fluid.

Terrified I'll end up in a wheelchair by Christmas.",9,jfj4no,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/jfj4no/poststroke_episodes_almost_monthly_robbing_me_of/,8,"I had my major stroke in April 2017 which affected my left side, arm and leg, and recovered to about 90% of my pre-stroke function. I had to learn to walk again, but really applied myself to rehab and Drs said my recovery was excellent.

28 Nov 2018, I had some kind of 'episode' that made my left side arm and leg feel more heavy, clumsy and numb on top of the parasthesia I already had.

MRI showed nothing, and report didn't indicate ALS or Multiple Sclerosis, which should have shown on the MRI.

10 March 2019, I had another, with more loss of function and increased numbness on the left side. Was admitted to hospital, but no diagnosis was made. Nothing showed up on MRI, X-ray to concern Drs.

22 December 2019, another 'episode' - more loss of function. I calculated I was down to 70% function in left arm and leg at this point.

I have since had other 'episodes', and they are getting more frequent and robbing me of feeling and function.  They occurred on;

* 2 March 2020
* 23 March 2020
* 13 April 2020
* 25 July 2020
* 13 Sept 2020
* 19 Oct 2020 - I am now down to what I consider 40% of function in my left arm and leg.

Two neurologists have been unable to identify what has been happening and these 'episodes' just keep on happening. Every time, I go backwards more with regard to my physical capability and the one three days ago has really made walking more difficult. It's as if my knee won't support me properly, and I cannot trust it not to 'fold' so I'm walking with the leg not fully straightened in the natural posture.

I read some scientific papers about caffeine consumption and strokes, but the neurologist I saw last time said there is no sign of stroke in my brain or medulla (which is where a blood clot lodged causing my major stroke in 2017).  He's mystified.  So I gave up my one cup of coffee a day, but still experienced more 'episodes' since. I also stopped diet soft drinks, but still, the episodes keep happening.  I'm at my wit's end here, and genuinely scared. It's 4am and here I am, crying because it seems nothing will stop these things because nobody knows what is going on.  In case it's relevant, I'm in Australia.

I have never smoked, maybe have two alcoholic drinks a year, don't take any drugs apart from the ones I'm on for health reasons. Now I cannot trust my left leg, and just ordered a walking stick on eBay, which has caused more tears.

Please, if anyone here has had a similar thing happen, can you let me know?  I'm terrified I'll be in a wheelchair soon, unable to drive, do my job, stay in my home.

Also have seen a therapist and taking a class on handling depression because every episode throws me into a funk. \n\nThe doctors think some of it is due to neck and back issues messing with nerves too and there's no sign of other stroke affects.

Don't know what to expect,8,j6ixh8,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/j6ixh8/close_friend_18_years_old_had_ischemic_stroke/,25,"Last night, my friend's mom called me at around midnight to let me know that my friend had an ischemic stroke. She's eighteen years old, was in completely fine health before this. Apparently she's been having seizures on and off since it started, and the MRIs are showing little to no improvement.

I'm hesitant to ask for more information since I know her mom is already having a hard time handling the whole situation and being the only point of contact for her friends who want to know what's going on. I didn't know anything about strokes before this. I've been reading a lot about ischemic strokes and what to expect, but it just feels impossible to know what's most likely to happen.

She just started college a month ago and she loves to read. She's the kind of person who goes through 2-3 books a week and was so excited to start college, even if it was going to be online this semester. I'm worried about what her life's going to be like afterwards.

Apparently there's been little improvement since she got to the hospital. MRIs and CAT scans are not showing the clot going down.

Is the fact that she's had 24 hours of seizures and little to no improvement in the first day going to mean she will likely have more challenges to face (memory/speaking/physical issues, etc) after recovery?

Her mom said she's stable, but if she's not improving, could this kill her?

I feel terrible because I'm halfway across the country right now, and due to the pandemic, I don't know if I'll be able to fly home to see her until November or December. I don't know if it'd be safe to visit, either. While I'm at college, I'm getting tested for covid-19 twice a week, but obviously the process of traveling back home would put me at a risk to carry it and obviously more illness would not help her situation.

She was coherent for a short while today and said she wanted to call me, another friend, and her sister later, but was unconscious for the rest of the afternoon, so I'm hoping maybe I'll get to talk to her tomorrow.

Is there anything that I should be prepared for?

To other young people who've had strokes, what did you most want out of your friends?

I feel so completely lost on this. I think of her as my younger sister.

And so on. Her personality may be altered.\n\nFor myself, I appreciated visits while I was in the hospital and rehab. Once home. Volunteers to drive me were very helpful, as I couldn't (cleared to drive again last week)."", 'I\'m going to be honest with you here. This isn\'t going to be pretty. \n\nYes having a lot of seizures is hard on her health. Yes this could kill her. \n\nIf she lives, be prepared that any parts or all of her memory may be impaired. One example is, I knew faces and voices and had a hard time with names - so I would see you and hear you and know I know you and from where and maybe even what we did together, but I couldn\'t remember your name. Almost five years later there are still people whose names I can\'t remember. \n\nBe prepared that she may not be able to communicate well for a while. Like, words may be hard for her, either to say or just to remember. I was able to pronounce words perfectly... remembering which words to pronounce was my problem. Some people with strokes can\'t pronounce things. I only slurred words when I was tired, and I knew it, and knew that if I was slurring words I must be tired.\n\nBe prepared that she may not have bodily control for a while. Like, initially they had catheters in me so I wouldn\'t have control of toilet functions, and then I wasn\'t allowed to stand up for months. \n\nBe prepared that she may have a lot of machines around her to test her or monitor various functions of her body. I\'m told while I was unconscious I was surrounded with every machine in the hospital. (The first thing I remember asking my father was ""Did I have [The Machine That Goes Ping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arCITMfxvEc)?"")\n\nWhat I most wanted out of my friends was for them to communicate with me - by phone or in person - and leave me alone to do therapy without anyone to see, because I knew I would have to do things I wasn\'t comfortable doing in front of my friends (do you really want your friends to see you learning to walk?) and I\'d be more comfortable without them to see. I had to tell a few friends to please come later or leave earlier so I could do therapy without them. I had to find the words to tell them why, which was the hard part. \n\nYou should *not* plan to visit your friend in the hospital. You could bring her the gift of a deadly disease. Phone her and ask someone to give her the phone, hold the phone for her, or put you on speaker. When I was in the hospital I didn\'t have anyone\'s phone numbers, my cell phone didn\'t work because the bill didn\'t get paid, and they kept taking it away from me so I couldn\'t look at its dialing directory to get numbers. If you need to see her have someone bring her a phone with skype or the Alexa app and put the app on your phone. If you can\'t get through to her (at designated times) call the hospital and freak out at them if necessary - they gave me the wrong number for the phone by my bed so everyone who knew me kept calling an empty bed and it just kept ringing, and when my father was in the hospital a few years later they actually lost him and we had to threaten to send in the police before they actually found him and got him on the phone.', 'When you do talk to her follow her lead,  if she‚Äôs sad comfort her- if she‚Äôs talking like nothing happened- make small talk, you get the idea. When I was in the hospital I had no idea what had happened to me and when people seemed scared or overly comforting it freaked me out. But I would also like to say Stroke recovery takes a very long time. You need to stay active in her life. I felt abandoned by friends and family weeks after I was released from the hospital. In the beginning people were all around offering rides, calling and sending little gifts Helping with whatever but after about a week that stopped.  I actually went an entire month at my lowest point, without communication from anyone with the exception of my one friend who lived across the country. She called daily in the beginning and then She memorized my rehab schedule and would send me morning texts to encourage me and she‚Äôd ask how it went. She‚Äôd send little gifts like tea and scent warmers to make me more comfortable when I was sad. My advice is to be there for her. You can do that from a distance,  but don‚Äôt stop, try to keep her in the forefront of your mind. Her life has changed dramatically and she is going to need lots of support. I‚Äôm two years post stroke now and still seeing improvements.', 'It‚Äôs too early to tell how this will affect her. Time moves very slowly, it seems, for everyone involved. Especially when even the doctors don‚Äôt have definitive answers.\n\nMay I suggest a Facebook group called Young Stroke Survivors? Almost 8,000 members sharing stories and tips. You and her family may find comfort there.', ""I can't speak to young stroke patients, but I would not fly unless it's absolutely necessary. Once she's up for it, you might want to try getting on Facetime with her. If her mom is in the hospital with her, she can probably just do it. Otherwise, I'm sure the hospital can arrange something. Not sure what the covid rules are where she is, but lots of hospitals probably still have iPads lying around from a few months ago even if visitors are now allowed in. It's obviously not as good as seeing each other IRL, but it's far safer than the alternative."", 'Check out the www.recoveryafterstroke.com podcast. It has interviews with stroke survivors.', 'I don\'t think anyone can fully speculate how hard this will actually influence her, it can pretty much be from quick full recovery to bedridden for  the rest of her life, so sadly you\'ll have to just wait and see. \n\nThe fact that she is so young means, that however bad she ends ups, she is likely to recover way more than an elderly or even middle-aged person. But as the stroke was so unexpected and involved several seizures etc, it is most probably a traumatic experience. Depending on her personality and stroke damage, she might actually get tired of all the initial attention, so keep an eye open for this. Often people find it really tiresome to tell the same story over and over to 10 different worrying friends and relatives. If she gets into a good rehabilitation programme, she might even be busy and tired enough to choose just a few people to update (tho I have a feeling you would be one :) ). Overall, as other have said, follow her lead. But very very often people feel alone when they finally are back home and everyone expects them to integrate back into their old lives and considers them healthy. So really be there for her when she comes back home, during the first year(s) after stroke. Get some new positive habits for her immediately and give her the opportunities to talk about the experience if she wants to. Like have regular brunches together, just the two of you or a few close friends. Take her out to places if she is isolating herself too much, she should stay as active as  she can. Post-stroke depression and anxiety are common and post-stroke PTSD is a thing.\n\nOh, and as she is a female - this might influence her family planning. Clotting is a common problem during pregnancy and postpartum period and we don\'t have too much research on pregnancy after stroke. It might not be the case with her at all, as it depends on the reason behind the stroke and there are many complicated aspects (like if you have to inject blood thinners during pregnancy, this in turn greatly increases the risk of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth etc). \n\nThe reason (etiology) behind the stroke is interesting in such a young person. There are these ""usual"" strokes, where the female is overweight, smoking and possibly on birth control pills, but this does not sound like it\'s the case here. I hope they find out what happened, as this helps to get a clearer picture of how much of an increased risk for further strokes (if any) will she have during her life. Not knowing this makes patients really worried as well. I mean even if you can have a family, how the hell do you plan one if you are afraid that a next stroke will happen any day now...']",876

&#x200B;

Where do i begin? I'm turning 35 in a few days and i had a hemorrhagic stroke in the morning of April 30th of this year. It was surreal, I was browsing the internet when i felt a tingle in my right arm, i tried to shake it out then i realized i was having a stroke when it wouldn't go away. I was very calm about the whole situation, actually thinking back it was kind of bizarre how calm i was. I walked to the living room where my uncle was sitting and told him about my situation, it was 3 am and he was having a hard time believing me because like i said i was pretty calm and at that moment did not present any stereotypical symptoms. Then right on cue i started slurring my words a bit and he got up to get ready to take me to the hospital, i then walked back to my room to get ready myself when it was like someone just cut the strings and my right side went limp and i collapsed under my weight. Again, at this point i am still incredibly present and in a weird way found this funny as i started laughing at my situation, i don't think that is normal but i wasn't panicking or scared. We got in around 30 min after the first symptoms where I spent 10 days in the ICU completely out of it fighting for my life, i woke up with a nice scar on my head from where they drained the blood and a realization of my current reality, still i was calm and thankful to be alive. I spent all of May in recovery and i dreaded leaving... i'll tell you why.

&#x200B;

I'm not super close to my family but they are still my family, they did help me but I can't expect them to wait on me hand and foot, which is why i spent my recovery focusing on being able to go to the bathroom and showering independently. Either way let's just say i didn't get the support i should be getting after such a life altering event. To be honest, they are completely na√Øve to what a stroke truly is and the challenges i would be facing, i mean they genuinely thought i would be back to normal after 4 months. So i went from a completely structured recovery program with a team of knowledgeable people to support me to being made to feel like a nuisance to other people because i had to have a chair in the shower because i couldn't stand yet, even though the chair weighed 5 pounds and can be removed after i take a shower. To further elaborate about how out of touch they were about my stroke, one morning i had a disagreement with my mother (for not letting her keep my SSN written down on a piece of paper with all of my info because i didn't want the chance for it to be stolen when it wasn't necessary) and it ended when her and my uncle were both ganging up and yelling at me trying to make me feel guilty for saying no... me, a stroke victim freshly out of the hospital with a brain injury. Of course being stuck in the middle of the living room in a situation i literally couldn't get up and walk away from, i did the only logical thing and had a full blown panic attack for the first time in my life as everybody stared at me. For a person who spends most of his time alone, i had never felt more alone in my entire life. i knew right there i couldn't rely on my family because they lacked the decency and the common sense to not yell at someone with a brain injury.

&#x200B;

I have the drive to return to normal, but i felt constrained because instead of seeking the best help i instead prioritized the distance of the therapy from my house to make it easier on the people who had to give me a ride, messed up right? To make matters worse even though they sent a few visits of therapy to my house, i didn't get outpatient therapy until a month after i was out of the hospital. so picture this, my uncle who was helping me with setting up appointments went on vacation so i was forced to try to navigate the bureaucracy of my medical insurance to find a provider and a specific outpatient program because the first provider i found tried to send me to a place an hour away. Oh, did i mention that i have never dealt with any of this before in my life and i still had a brain injury? Well i found a nice place for my physical therapy but i messed up and signed up for hand therapy at a place that didn't deal with neurological disorders, as a matter of fact neither of them specialized in helping neuro patients, but it was 10 min from my house and I was in desperate need of any kind of therapy.  my last session was last week as i am moving in with my mom because i realized although this has been my home for the past 10 years, i can't get the kind of support i need to fully recover. My mom is pretty na√Øve to my situation as well but at least with her i wont be made to feel like a burden.

&#x200B;

Through it all i've tried to keep it together, besides my physical issues i've tried to keep my life from seeming completely different. I've always kept my expectations of my recovery very high, i am still in that mindset that my arm and leg are asleep and any moment ill be able to move it the way i want, i remember the feeling, i just need my brain to remember. it wasn't until a few hours ago when i was watching a video about spasticity when the person said ""there was no cure for spasticity"", that after 5 months i finally broke down crying from the realization that my life, no matter what, will never be the same again. Then i started thinking about before covid, every job i ever had was physical labor and how i dont have any savings. I can't fail, i can't listen to statistics, i have to recover or else i wont survive... it is literal life and death for me.

Thank you for reading this far, i've had to get that off my chest for the past 4 months, I do have some questions if you would be so kind.

&#x200B;

*  Right now i'm on medi-cal in orange county, ill have to call them soon because im moving to LA county and it is a different health insurance agency from OC (caloptima), does anyone know if i can switch over with the same insurance or if i have to start the process all over?
* As i told you about getting the therapy a little later then i would have wanted and not getting the neuro specific therapy, did i mess up? I know the first few months are really important, even though i feel i could be much further, i still got work done and have progressed in the past 4 months regardless.
* When searching for a new provider, does it matter what they specialize in? I chose a clinic that had a bunch of family doctors because they were easier to get a meeting when i needed them and they were part of the health network i chose. In other words i'm trying to build a neuro team because i've never had this, i feel like ive haven't been getting the help that i needed and i've been flying blind ever since i left recovery. Covid has complicated things and getting a hold of doctors for advice has been difficult. i'm just trying to give myself the best chance i can...
* How much of the recovery really gets done at therapy and how much does it get done at home when you're by yourself? How many hours/sessions should you have of each per week?
* How important is OT? From my time with OT in recovery it has always been about things like brushing your teeth, putting on clothes, doing your laundry, etc. Then i read more about it and it's actually where they focus on physical therapy for your upper body. When i didn't know any better i chose hand therapy thinking thats what i needed.
* when searching for an outpatient facility for my therapy, is there anything specific i should look out for?

Think of recovering as a full time job, if you can spend half the day working on getting better then do it. Don't give up, therapy is extremely important because the therapists can teach you what to work on in order to get better.\n5) OT is a mix between taking care of yourself and upper body therapy. A good occupational therapist will plan the activities around what you need, for example my dad regained his movement but not his understanding so they worked on playing games and understanding activities. If you have paralysis with an arm OT is what will help with that, from what I've seen PT typically focuses on lower body.\n6) You should look for a facility that you can afford/is covered by insurance obviously.

The next day he mentioned having woken up in the middle of the night and seeing another patient sitting in the corner of his room. He fell asleep again briefly and woke up and they were gone. I guessed it was a dream since they likely wouldn't let people enter rooms in the ICU, especially during Covid... But then he asked me if I saw the writing on the wall. There was no writing on the wall. I told him there was no writing and he said, ""Well I'm not going to call ya a liar."" and we went about our visit.

My 65-year old mother suffered from a TIA stroke in mid-March, was then sent to an acute rehab clinic here in South Carolina, where she contracted Covid-19 and continued to (asymptomatically) test positive until June 21st. 

During the roughly three months in the hospital, she received zero physical therapy. She is now home with my father since June 22nd, either in bed or in a wheelchair in the living room, as her muscles have atrophied significantly. 

She predominantly receives nutrition and meds through a stomach / PEG tube, and gets physical and occupational therapy 3-4 times a week. She has started eating small portions of yogurt or other soft foods, and is drinking water. 

I am not local and have only been able to see her four times so far. That gives me a bit of longer-term perspective to note her progress, and she is most definitely making progress. Her left side is still weak, but she is fully ‚Äúwith it‚Äù mentally, speaking well, and has made strength improvements on her right side. 

That said, she is being the definition of a horrible patient. Constant whining, complaining, scratching at bruises on her arms (she bruises easily due to rheumatoid arthritis), removing bandages that my dad has placed to cover skin tears, pulling at her stomach tube, lying about wet diapers, etc. - the list goes on and on. She‚Äôs essentially a toddler, to the point of having a cotton glove on her hand to keep her from scratching herself. Even worse, she‚Äôs fully aware of what she‚Äôs doing, which makes the situation that much more peculiar. 

The most peculiar challenge is that she is fighting sleep. We were convinced early on that she lost her sense of night and day after so long in the hospital, but she continues to wake up around 2-3am and is an absolute terror for my dad until 5-6am. 

She started getting Melatonin early on, to no avail. As of last Tuesday, she has been getting Ambien, but is still waking up in the middle of the night and endlessly whining and being generally restless. Needless to say, this lack of sleep only exacerbates the problems and puts a cloud over the day that follows. Obviously this is taking its toll on my 68-year old dad as well. 

What are we missing here? This isn‚Äôt sustainable for much longer. Is this the depression that you hear about with stroke patients? What are some measures we can take to move forward??

If specific medications and dosages would help, I can ask my dad for that info.

883,Possible stroke when I was 16 and confused about what to do now,8,hw237m,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/hw237m/possible_stroke_when_i_was_16_and_confused_about/,6,"This is my first post on Reddit, but I'm desperate for advice and I don't know where to go from here.

Let me start by saying this was six years ago and I'm now 22. I have always been a sickly person and I've seen dozens of doctors over the years due to a multitude of weird medical issues. As a child, I was always weak, easily injured, and clumsy, but when I was 9 I started fainting and when I was 11 I started having major dislocations. At 15 I got diagnosed with dysautonomia and a connective tissue condition along with some congenital issues. Everything really got bad when I was 16 and my coworkers found me either unconscious or close to it on the floor at work. They tried to stand me up, but my left side was paralyzed and my face was drooping. The only thing that I remember from that day was my boss telling me I could have stayed home if I didn't feel well and I tried to say ""I felt okay this morning."" I didn't know this until a year ago when I saw a coworker from that day and she said my words were slurred and didn't make sense. My mom came to pick me up and because she did not know the signs of stroke and I already had heart problems she thought it was just a weird fainting episode and took me home. This is also where it gets complicated. My dad has been abusive for most of my life and was already very angry that I was weak and sickly from previous medical issues. He refused to acknowledge that his child was disabled. He is very much the type that does not understand disability and therefore thinks you just have to push through it and you'll be fine. In the past, he had refused to give me my medications or assistive devices. So... when this possible stroke happened he, of course, did not believe it and I did not see a doctor that day or any other day for over a month and rarely after that considering what had happened. When I finally did see a doctor and had an MRI it came back normal. Also, I was still confused and tired and a minor so none of my side of the story came out. Yes, I had medical issues prior to this, but never facial drooping, weakness/paralysis one side, slurred speech, blurred vision, or seizures. It all started on that one day. Since this was not explained, doctors seemed to have thought this was the progression of issues I already had and MS, ALS, myasthenia gravis, and more were ruled out before the issue was just dropped altogether and I was told to do therapy and move on with my life. The problem is that even after years of physical and occupational therapy, I still have weakness on one side, seizures, sensory issues, and memory problems. I can't just move on. It kills me that I have no support and no understanding from family, friends, or doctors because I don't have a diagnosis for that life-changing day on paper. I had never even considered a stroke until I was shadowing an OT(I'm studying to be an OT now because of this experience) and I told her about it and she said that that sounds exactly like a stroke and they don't always show on MRI. I also work at a pediatricians office and I've recently told some nurses and physicians about it and they agree that it was a textbook stroke. We discussed possible causes for it and they asked if I was ever injured badly leading up to it and yes, I had a major horseback riding accident with several dislocated and broken bones and I hit my head (again never saw a doctor for the head injury, just the broken bones.) Now my question is do I keep trying to get an answer from my own doctor? Could she even give me an answer 6 years later? I just feel like I desperately need support from other people this has happened to but I don't feel right joining a stroke survivor support group or anything without an official diagnosis. It drives me crazy that this could have all been different if my dad had chosen to make sure I got medical care instead of hiding my disability so it wouldn't damage his picture of the ""perfect family.""

EDIT: I should also mention I was just told this year we have a significant history of stroke in my family after my dad had a stroke at 50 years old in March. His dad had one in his 30s. ",2020-07-22 21:01:27+00:00,"['Are you me?  Very similar thing happened to me at 18/19.  They couldn\'t see the stroke on scans until I had a high powered MRI 12 years after my stroke.\n  \nEdit because I only saw the first half of the post at first for some reason:    \n\n1. BTW, I also have EDS and dysautonomia.  And I was also thought to have a bunch of neurodegenerative things like ALS, MS, MELAS, etc.  It was actually ""just"" strokes and spinal cord issues.    \n\n2. I\'m an OT!!!!!

Nope, it was just that I could nearly dislocate my C1 and C2 just using my own muscle power and my spinal cord was getting squished.)  \n\n3. For me, pursuing the diagnosis of stroke was important for two reasons.  The first was to confirm I had a stroke, find the cause, and prevent future strokes. I had lots of TIAs and strokes, so I knew it wasn\'t a one off fluke thing.  So for that reason, it could be very helpful to pursue a stroke dx.  I had a doctor who believed it was a stroke even if the scans didn\'t show it so I got proper treatment (deplin for MTHFR, blood thinners, and heart defect surgery).  The other reason was more of an identity one.  Was I a stroke survivor?  Was that part of who I was?  I wanted a concrete answer when someone asked me what was wrong with me.  This was VERY important to me at first.  Lots of angst over it.  As I got other pieces of medical stuff figured out and became more stable/secure in my other identities it mattered much less.  By the time I had the MRI confirmation of the big stroke (12 years later), I didn\'t care much anymore.  That\'s not to say it wasn\'t still important...just less so over time.  \nBut for either or both of these reasons, I do think it could be beneficial for you to pursue this.

I recommend you see someone else. You have a lot of medical problems, your current doctor doesn\'t seem to be able to either give you any relief or reassure you, and someone else might be able to give you fresh perspective. \n\nMake sure to talk to the new doctor in terms of ""I have these symptoms"" rather than ""I have these diagnoses"", because you want them to be able to form a picture of your problems without being biased by someone else\'s diagnoses. Since the whole point is for them to be able to give you a fresh start, you don\'t want them to be bound by someone else\'s opinions.', ""Hi we are nursing students, who are displaced from clinical due to Covid-19. We have found the following information to answer your question relating to stroke.\n\nStroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. When this occurs, brain cells do not get enough oxygenated blood and can cause permanent damage of the brain. There are 2 types of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic. **Ischemic stroke** happens when there is a blockage of blood, brought by blood vessels to the brain, also called blood clots. Over time substances like fat and cholesterol build up and harden. These substances that form on the wall are known as plaque and over time can cause the blood vessels to become narrower, which will reduce blood flow. A **Hemorrhagic stroke** occurs when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain, causing leakage of blood to the brain. \n\nA CT scan of the head also known as computed tomography is a special x-ray that uses sophisticated computers that can produce multiple images of the body from the inside. Doctors use this to detect strokes that are formed from blood clots. A CT angiography can be used as well but this uses a contrast material that gets injected intravenously and this allows images of the cerebral blood vessels. These can be one of the best methods to help doctors decide which therapy can be used for a patient who is experiencing a stroke.\n\nA MRI can be used as well since it helps produce detailed images of the organs and the internal body structures. When used on the head it shows the blood flow to the brain and allows doctors to see the damage to the brain from a stroke.\n\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) checks the heart‚Äôs electrical activity and it can determine if someone is having heart problems that are being caused by a stroke.\n\nAspirin and warfarin can be given to help thin the blood, as well heparin or clopidogrel can be given to prevent strokes from occurring. Stroke caused by a clot may be treated with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). TPA is used to dissolve the clot and help restore blood flow to the damaged areas of the brain. \n\nPatients can receive post-stroke rehabilitation to be able to overcome the disabilities that may occur as a result of the stroke. These treatments can also help prevent further strokes from occurring by controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\n\nThere are many approaches to stroke rehabilitation. Your rehabilitation plan will depend on the part of the body or type of ability affected by your stroke.\n\nPhysical activities might include:\n\n* **Motor-skill exercises.** These exercises can help improve your muscle strength and coordination. You might have therapy to strengthen your swallowing.\n* **Mobility training.** You might learn to use mobility aids, such as a walker, canes, wheelchair or ankle brace. The ankle brace can stabilize and strengthen your ankle to help support your body's weight while you relearn to walk.\n* **Constraint-induced therapy.** An unaffected limb is restrained while you practice moving the affected limb to help improve its function. This therapy is sometimes called forced-use therapy.\n* **Range-of-motion therapy.** Certain exercises and treatments can ease muscle tension (spasticity) and help you regain range of motion.\n\nHere are some signs and symptoms you should look out for in case you think you may be having a stroke: \n\n* Numbness in your face, arms, or legs, especially if it is one sided\n* Sudden confusion or trouble with speaking\n* Blurred vision or difficulty seeing\n* Dizziness, balance issues, poor coordination\n* Sudden severe headache\n\nIt is important to take note of the time when your symptoms appear, and do not drive to the hospital yourself. The earlier you seek medical care, the better you can be taken care of without your condition worsening.\n\nDisclaimer: We are not medical doctors.

My granny and I are extremely close, she‚Äôs like my second mum, me, her and my mum are all really close. Throughout lockdown we‚Äôve been doing her shopping etc and then 3 weeks ago she started getting really dizzy. She got quickly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and got told that‚Äôs a stroke risk and got put on aspirin. 

My and my mum have been looking after her and coming to monitor her blood pressure every day; it started off really high (she was on meds for this anyway) and gradually became very low with a low pulse rate. On Wednesday I saw her and she started crying saying she didn‚Äôt want to die. Important to note she‚Äôs been extremely anxious the past few weeks, asking questions constantly and having panic attacks. 

On Friday, me my mum and my sister were driving down somewhere and about an hour and a half into the journey we got a call saying she‚Äôs in hospital with a suspected stroke. We asked how she got to hospital and apparently she was due to call the doc that day but she didn‚Äôt, so he called her and she was slurring down the phone so he called an ambulance. He basically saved her life. We had a horrible drive back up, I was driving and shaking and crying the whole time and on the journey we got a call saying it was a full blown stroke. 

We obviously couldn‚Äôt go into the hospital but we waited outside while she had a procedure to remove the clot from her brain. She was almost rushed to the next city but they found a specialist onsite who could do it, again this was lucky as they said later she wouldn‚Äôt have made the journey. 

Waiting while she had the procedure was horrific. Finally we got told it was a success and to go home because we can‚Äôt see her. 

The next day we heard she‚Äôs improved a LOT, she was already walking and talking fine and could write with her right hand - she‚Äôs right handed and that‚Äôs what side was affected. I was so SO happy, but her cognition isn‚Äôt great. She‚Äôs finding it hard to understand and process information and find words, which seems to be very normal? She‚Äôs also very vacant, when usually she‚Äôs loud and talks a LOT. She‚Äôs not asking any questions either which isn‚Äôt like her.

So today she was supposed to come home but we got a call saying she‚Äôs a candidate for a trial in which they think this stroke medication can be taken earlier than normal, but there‚Äôs a risk of bleeding on the brain whether she does the trial or not. We consented. Was this the right thing to do? 

I guess what i‚Äôm worried about is this. There was a lot of talk of a further stroke risk which is scaring the LIFE out of me. Me and mum have been staying at her house because she was already scared of burglaries after having been burgled 2 years ago. I arrived on my own on Saturday and completely broke down when I walked in and she wasn‚Äôt in her usual spot. Sounds silly but I completely freaked.

I then calmed down until today, with all that talk of a second stroke.

Basically- should we have consented to the trial? Should we be wary of a second stroke? Also- because she was so scared before this she‚Äôs been very emotional and crying about dying. A doctor said to her today ‚Äòbecause you smoke, a second one will kill you.‚Äô Firstly who says that?!? Secondly she quit smoking 12 years ago? So obviously this has made her very upset and she won‚Äôt be able to forget it. She‚Äôs quite stuck in her ways and probably won‚Äôt have therapy. I‚Äôm just scared that she will never be the same, or just have another stroke. How can I stop from worrying? She means the WORLD to me. She‚Äôs 71 btw

EDITED to add: She‚Äôs coming home tomorrow instead so they can start her on the trial, she lives on her own but mum is moving in with her and I am going to take over when I can. I said I‚Äôd do it full time but she said no. It‚Äôs understandable as Id be the same for her. She lives in a bungalow which had some rails and stuff anyway which is good. Another positive is that mum is an OT - well she lectures in it now, but she was an OT in practice in mental health before that. So hopefully mum can help her find some meaningful occupation, even though she‚Äôs scared and resistant. I‚Äôm currently looking after her bungalow right now and I‚Äôm just stressing out so bad",2020-07-13 23:32:47+00:00,"['The only thing I can say is to try and stay positive.

Currently home after four days in the hospital. As the ICU doctor said, I got incredibly lucky that I decided to have my wife take me to emergency room instead of sleeping it off as I considered. In fact we got a block down the street and I told her to stop at the fire station who had an ambulance off to the ER.  I got in fast enough that the first sign of it was a stroke was that I had to tell the EMT that I was having a hard time speaking which degenerated from there. I was pretty much lucid the entire time but could not speak clearly. The neurologist was on a computer screen analyzing things and I was in for a CT scan that showed a small clot deep in small arteries. Because of the time they recommended TPA and I got it along with another CT during the process.  

I'm not sure of the exact timeline but I managed to say two clear sentences about an hour later and a half hour after that could seemingly talk normally. Spent the next couple days in ICU getting innumerable blood draws and tests of hands, feet, and eyes quite often. None of which I ever had problems doing. The discussion at that point was when I could go home but they moved me out of the ICU to the stroke unit for another night and it's probably good they did. 

That night I had a recurrence of symptoms. Shivering like I was freezing, a rapid flush up my face and head, and my speech degenerated again. Thankfully another CT scan showed no blockage or bleeding and the next morning I was fine. That got me an extra two days of hospital observation. Thankfully nothing like that has reoccurred although I do get a flush after eating, typically in the evening and I'm certainly more emotional. Coworkers and my boss reaching out has left me crying at the care and concern several times but I understand that to be a normal symptoms. The doctors felt that it was more clot dissolving and that the current drug regime they had me on was still the best course.

At this point the doctors don't know what caused it. Heart appears healthy with extensive sonogram testing, cholesterol within normal ranges although a little high for me and lots of tests that came back normal except for slightly elevated in on amino acid which has links to not enough B12. They're not done with tests and monitoring yet but my primary thought is to figure it out and try to fix it. Losing 20 pounds and walk more is a given but any thought you all have would be appreciated. I have doctor appointments next week and another visit with the neurologist. 

What questions should I be asking? Will life ever be normal again? I was an active person with lots of projects that involved physical labor. I won't push it but would like know if I should even consider doing them again. All questions for doctors too but I'd appreciate any insight the rest of you might have. From what I'm told and reading I got extremely lucky and I remember laying there, tears running down my face at what they were saying and telling my wife that I didn't want to be stupid.

I went on to have a TIA in 2017 and that made things more complicated. Whatever caused the stroke was still there and managed to trigger a TIA despite being on Plavix. So they added low dose aspirin to the Plavix and I went through a period of even more extensive testing. Again, nothing... So I was referred to a consulting neurologist to have him try and figure it out. He found something in my medical records, I had my yearly physicals right before the stroke and TIA, and one of the lab tests pointed towards high inflammation levels. So he referred me to a rheumatologist to be screened for autoimmune disease. And it turns out that I have an autoimmune disease that has been linked to strokes (Sjogren's syndrome). It can cause vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) which can trigger strokes and heart attacks. Did the Sjogren's cause my stroke and TIA? It's the only thing that makes sense. Is it certain that the Sjogren's was the cause? No, there's no way to know for sure. But I'm being treated for it and haven't had another stroke or TIA since 2017, so that's at least promising. But I'm staying on Plavix and low dose aspirin just in case.""]",910

Hi. My daughter had a stroke at 13 months old in May 2018. It was on the right side of her brain and her left side was affected. Her pediatrician missed obvious symptoms and it went undiagnosed for 36 hours. (We don‚Äôt see this doctor anymore.) She was in the hospital for 2 weeks, did inpatient therapy for 2 weeks, and then did outpatient therapy for 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, for 2 months. Now a year and a half later, I would say she has little to no residual effects. (That we can see.)
Curious to hear from any other people who know or had a stroke as a child. I wonder and think about what her future looks like. Will she struggle in school? Will she plays sports or not be coordinated enough for them?
We also could never find an exact cause. Which feels frustrating sometimes but also gives me hope nothing will ever happen again. She was taking a half a baby aspirin daily until this past September when she had a brief hospital stay after we believe she suffered from a TIA. Now she takes a full baby aspirin (81mg).",2019-12-05 13:58:44+00:00,"[""Not a doctor or anything, but I've been told that the earlier it happens in life the easier it is on the person and affects their life less.\n\nI've had a stroke about 6 months ago at 21 on my right temporal lobe, and have little side effects. Stress definitely causes me to lose concentration and leads me to lots of confusion so I can see how that can affects the  childs education if similar side effects show. A stressful test or an exam could be totally failed if the child has these effects and no accommodations are give.\n\nAs for sports, I've been lifting at the gym for a few years and got back to it about 2 months after the stroke. My neurologist gave me the green light to participate on sports and also that light cardio is recommended to help the circulation. I can do everything I was able to do before with my only limitation being very rare occasional numbness in my left arm (I can still use it fine just feels as if it was different/not my own)\n\nOverall, lots of people that have it at a young age can still live and good and healthy life (according to my doctor)\n\nHopefully it was at least a little useful"", ""My 6 y/o is a pediatric stroke survivor.  They suspect it was early in utero.  He had a left MCA and was left with right sided weakness and spacticity issues.  He was delayed as a baby but mostly caught up now.  Lots and lots of early intervention can help.  If you have Help Me Grow in your area, look into it.  We were able to get our son into early intervention at 14 months old (in addition to doing PT and OT) and he stayed there until he went to kindergarten this school year.  Help Me Grow covers your child until they are 3 years old offering free services.  Your school district may also have to offer her services after that depending upon your area.  For the most part my son has done okay in school.  Being in E.I. really helped.  He is struggling a bit now with some areas and has tested as having a slow memory response (just means it takes him a couple more times of something being explained if it's complex than it would for others), and he has some issues when some words or letters/numbers look the similar to identify which is which.  He does not currently have an IEP (he did when he was younger but lost it just before the school year because he no longer qualified) but we will probably get a new one based on these new issues.  Currently though the teachers are working to give him more time and assistance to complete his work.  We did a neuropsych report over the summer that gave us an idea of what some difficulties might be for him.  He has foot drop which made him trip a lot and we got our first AFO when he was about 2 or so.  He now wears a walkaide that sends electrical stimulation to pull his toes up when he walks and he loves it.  At first kids were curious but they were all very accepting of it.  He is just slightly slower than the other kids but keeps up for the most part.  He does dislike that they can flip the monkey bars and he can't though.  Someone mentioned seizures, and our son started having them at age 4.  His so far have all been in his sleep.  If you suspect anything, make sure you record and time it to show your doctor.  Sportswise, he could probably play a few different things.  We have opted for taekwondo right now and he really likes it.  Yoga is great for stroke kids too because of all the stretching.  If you're on FB and haven't already joined, you should join the CHASA parent group.

One third will always need help, another third will be pretty self sufficient and need some minor assistance, and the final third to the untrained eye people would never know they had a stroke.

I had posted earlier this week, my mother suffered a stroke which caused bleeding, losing functions to her right arm and leg. They had her medication treatment to reduce it but eventually had to operate when it didnt work. She seems to be stable now so we're looking to getting started on her recovery. 

My question is, I've done some reading and that the core affected area is considered dead cells and can no longer be rewired. Does that mean the functions lost to these cells will never come back? I understand that each case is different but I am terrified that dead cells mean those functions are lost forever.

All the statistics I‚Äôve read regarding this type of stroke are so negative and soul crushing. 
Are there any success stories with hemorrhagic strokes? Please tell me I‚Äôll get my mom back.",2019-09-23 13:23:40+00:00,"[""Hey,\n\nI understand the struggle you are going through.  My father similarly was in the hospital for nearly two months after his hemorrhagic stroke before being released home (recently), but the release was due to insurance running out, not 'recovery.'\n\nIn regards to the Blood Pressure, my father also had substantial issues with control in the hospital.  Despite the 3 different meds they were using he was in the 140s/150s systolic.  We discovered a great solution for him that I want to recommend to you as well - **CBD oil**.  This is not the stuff that gets you 'high' (that is THC).  Where I live, CBD oil can be bought in stores over the counter but THC is still strictly illegal.  However, CBD is incredible for helping stroke survivors for two important reasons.  (1) It substantially reduces blood pressure, (2) It directly reduces inflammation in the brain (this is why its so powerful for epilepsy patients).  We started off my father with about 100-150 mg per day, split between sub-lingual oil drops and swallowed capsules.  It brought him down to 120/80 within a day.  There is limited research in the subject but people think CBD can become the next TPA (but work longer after the stroke), since in mice studies it reversed stroke symptoms if administered intravenously within 5 days after stroke.  I only got it to my father weeks after his stroke, but regardless it helps the BP and hopefully neuroinflammation too.     \n\nDiscussion of her long-term prognosis is truly uncertain, since every stroke is so different - even if it hits the same exact area.  However, what I have seen with my father is that he was completely flaccid in arm and leg for over a month and only after LOTS and LOTS of varied therapy minor tone and motion began to return.  The real lesson here is to not give up, because it is expected that quality of life will improve just uncertain how much.  Before my father could even move his leg, they would brace his knee and have him stand upright, strapped into a table.  He had no left side control at that time (completely flaccid), but he was continuously **bearing weight** through the left leg since they kept him standing.  We think this is why he finally took some of his first **assisted** steps on a hemiplegic walker recently.  The arm has come back much slower, but the best thing you can do a few times per day is hold her wrist and elbow and carefully move her arm through a range of motion exercise.  Alternate between her trying to fight back and not trying to fight back.  After doing this for a month, I can finally begin to feel my dad fighting back when he wants, even if the muscle recruitment is not yet enough to move against gravity.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, 60 days is truly not long in the 'stroke' scheme of things.  If she is still in the completely flaccid phase, focus on range of motion and weight bearing exercises.  Celebrate every accomplishment, no matter how minor.  She is still healing from the stroke and her blood is still being reabsorbed, so this is really an early recovery stage."", ""My mom had a hemorrhagic stroke 14 years ago and is doing well today.

Honestly, I don't know where to start.  I feel lucky it was mild, but I'm terrified.  She's mostly ok now, she's home.  No memory loss that I know of, she can walk and has her balance.  She really is mostly ok.  Slight droop in her lip.  

We went for a good walk last night, nothing crazy just a walk.  She helped with dishes and minor other chores too.  She is having issues with writing, which is frustrating to her.  I have hope she will get that back in time with therapy.

I have read things and our follow up appointments are Monday.

I don't know if I'm asking for help, or just letting it out.  I'm not sure what to do.  Everything says that a diet change is needed, which I have already started to do.

I never had experience with doctors or medical emergencies. But I keep seeing stories of people in bad accidents where doctors give worst-case scenario expectations, but people recover. The patients will be in comas for months or years, my dad was only in a coma for a few days.

It was in the front left portion of his brain so it affected his speech heavily. He had no lasting problem with paralyzation of limbs but struggled for the first 3 weeks with feeding himself and really didn't eat much at all during this time.  He also had something called hypernatremia which was causing him to hallucinate from low sodium levels in the blood. He could only put a few words together but none of it made sense for about the first week. During the second week he was able to slowly speak sentences during mid-day. For some reason he struggled heavily in the morning and at night. During the third week he started having seizures and on the worst day they were occurring about every 30 minutes. My family and I were having talks about how we would deal with not being able to communicate with him like we used to. Around this time I remember a day where I saw a look of  complete fear in his eyes that I never saw before. At this time a switch flipped in him and he realized he'd have to make some major efforts if he wanted to stick around with us much longer. He had been having medical issues such as peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, overweight, severed bicep muscle and fused disc in his neck. Sounds like my dad's situation was a little backwards from yours. He went into it depressed and the stroke actually snaped him out of it. When he was in the hospital I did read him a couple success stories from this forum and that seemed to comfort him alot. My mother kept detailed notes for every day of recovery and the progress he made. We were offered basic rehab but then found out they offered acute rehab to those who showed improvement. My mother's notes help build a case to get accepted into this. My dad seems to be fully recovered from the stroke now and he blames a lot of the success on the acute rehab although I feel a major portion of it was the attitude adjustment he made that third week. My two sisters and mother and myself were there pretty much every day and I believe this helped a lot. Sounds like you got that part covered.

About 7 months ago, my she had a neurological event...  presented like a stroke in every way.  Facial droop, left sided paralysis. head pain, vision problems.  Was admitted to our local hospital where she underwent full workup.  CT, MRI, bloodwork, whole deal.

CT and MRI were inconclusive.  Bloodwork was positive for clotting factor, but that‚Äôs not definitive.

She‚Äôs been left with partial paralysis on her left side; needs a walker to get around, her left arm and hand are impacted.  Her focus and short term memory are shattered, she‚Äôs in constant pain, her moods are erratic.   She has aphasia, and trouble swallowing.  

She has been unable to get a diagnosis...  the ER doctors didn‚Äôt agree...  she had a stroke. She didn‚Äôt have a stroke.  She had a stroke because her tumour is back, she didn‚Äôt have a stroke and the tumour isn‚Äôt back.  How 4 doctors can look at the same images and see 4 different things boggles the mind.  The neurologist was even worse; basically saying he has no idea, and she should just continue as is.

It‚Äôs hard - I know she‚Äôs frustrated.  At 42, she‚Äôs had to give up her career (she was a nurse) - she is in pain, she‚Äôs angry because of how easily she tires, how she‚Äôs lost her freedom. Financially, it‚Äôs impacted our family, as well.

941,Trouble coping,8,9q6kb6,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/9q6kb6/trouble_coping/,5,"My dad had a massive ischemic stroke on July 29th of this year. For the last five years I was living out of state due to work and school. I quit my job and was moving home to spend the last few ""good years"" with my parents. My move home date? That same July 29th. He has been in rehab ever since his stroke and he still cannot speak and has very limited mobility in his right leg. No movement in his right arm. He is 69 years old, and, up until the time of his stroke, was relatively healthy - working 40 hours a week in a steel mill. 

While the initial news was shocking, the immediate days following the stroke (spent in the ICU) were devastating, these last few weeks have been almost unbearable. He hasn't gotten much better  as the progress seems to have slowed down and those initial support systems of friends have dwindled as the texts and calls asking about him are almost non-existent. My mother spends her days at the hospital and my brother visits on weekends (he's away at college) and I once again find myself out of state, training for a new job, a job that will economically provide for my mother and brother since my dad can no longer do so.

I guess I just feel heartbroken, confused, and pretty alone through this. Heartbroken for my father, who didn't deserve this (no one does). Confused because he was **fine** up until that time. It just *happened*. And I catch myself feeling guilty knowing that I spent those aforementioned ""good years"" out of state, only seeing him on holidays and maybe a month during the summer when I had vacation time from work. Alone because, well, I am. I have no real support system through this as I am attempting to be the pillar of support for my mother and brother. I have no spouse. No children. No close friends. 

I guess I just don't know where to turn. Overwhelmed and sad, I spend a few minutes every day rereading his text messages and listening to his voicemails from a few days prior to his stroke wondering if that's the last time I'll ever hear his voice. 

Talked to mom today and she said he is being quite difficult at rehab. Refusing to wear splints and braces and his shoulder is slowly dislocating. Rehab facility said if he doesn't start complying with treatment he may be removed from the facility itself. Our house is not a house where he could live. Too many steps separative bathrooms, showers, and bedrooms. He simply can't go back there and the house is not in a condition to be sold as it needs a new roof. 

I just don't really know what to do and I can't help but feel depressed regarding all of it. ",2018-10-21 19:53:37+00:00,"['There‚Äôs a stroke support group of Facebook called Stroke Survivors. There are 13,000 members. I suggest you join, ASAP. \n\nYour dad‚Äôs (and your) experience is not unique. It sounds like a lot of others that I have heard. The trimming of the friends list is VERY common, by the way. On the bright side, think how much you‚Äôll save on Christmas cards and postage this year.\n\nRegarding the shoulder: it‚Äôs called Subluxation, and it is unbelievably painful once the tendons holding the shoulder together relax completely and stretch out. It is NOT reversible, except through surgery. He absolutely must wear that sling. I didn‚Äôt an paid dearly for it.\n\nI set up a survivor‚Äôs website:\n[http://www.strokesite.com ]\n\nI compiled what I‚Äôve learned about making the best of a bad situation. I invite you to visit the site. Hang in there. Be strong.', '(I do not know how to format Reddit comments so sorry for wall of text here, though I\'ll try some line breaks for the first time...might not work right)    \n    \n\nI am very sorry to hear about what happened to your father, and what is happening to you. This is happening to you too, which you feel, but its important to recognize. My situation has some similarities: in Feb my wife had a similar stroke with similar resulting deficits. She was healthy  and only 50. I can only speak to our experience, and being her husband is much different than your being a son. But I also have two kids, at the time of the stroke one in college and one in HS (since on to college too). Enough background, my thoughts on your situation:    \n    \n    \n\n\nRegarding your brother: He should make sure two-to-three contacts are made at his college. He must go to financial aid and let them know the situation and change of his support. It is exceptional that you are stepping in to help, but the college should not be counting on your help if they have more aid they can offer. Two: his dean should be put on notice about this, including his travel and time burdens. The day after my wife\'s stroke we met with my daughters dean and she was given a ton of support and latitude on her work while we got ourselves together. Third, if he will, he should schedule some time with a school counselor; they deal with all sorts of issues and even if he\'s functional he has burdens he may not even recognize or feel comfortable sharing (like, maybe he\'s worried about you...but you\'re not a good audience for that one).\n    \n    \n\n\nRegarding you: You were already doing a truly wonderful thing my moving back to be near your parents. They felt that already and it is extra special now. Give yourself some credit for that. You also need to take some time for you along the way. Your training and all is great and your commitment to bring financial help is so very impressive, but frankly- you are not the head of the family and you don\'t have to break yourself down to do everything. It\'s hard without a support network- very hard- and you need to do what you can for you. I can\'t know what will work for you, but I found exercise important (do it! it helps in so many ways), just get outside and walk around, I play video games when I just need to be not thinking for a while...whatever. But do something, as much as you can.\n    \n    \n\n\nRegarding your mom: You are already doing so much for her, and she knows it and she feels it. She is being with your dad, and that\'s her deal for now. If she is breaking down you may need to come up with some strategies for her, but you didn\'t say anything like that so I\'m letting it go for the here and now.\n    \n    \n\n\nRegarding a support network: Any support you can build is critical. We were lucky, my wife had a great network and it really helped. One thing we did was start a blog (on a site called CaringBridge, for what it\'s worth) and tell all contacts about it and encourage them to sign up for email notices when we posted an update. This did two things for us. The face-value one was to save a lot of redundant conversations and communications, which is a good thing. But the more subtle thing is it allowed for the updates to encourage visits or other forms of support (be blunt or subtle, that\'s up to you)... stay front of mind and people do want to do things to help.\n    \n    \n\n\nRegarding the house: Some thought does need to go into how he will get along when he gets back home. He will get back home, and it will happen quickly once it does. My wife was in ICU for a week and then in-patient rehab for 2.5 months, but only in the last two or three weeks did they move to ""Ok, going home soon"" and it really rushes up to you. Even if you have to get a bed into a living room or something, its useful to start getting your head around it. But we found that for my wife at least her functionality improved once home too, and the triage efforts could be slowly pulled back to a more normal (but certainly not really normal) situation. Which brings us too..\n    \n    \n\n\nYour dad: No way to know where he will get to though he\'s had some time to recover already. I am sorry where he is is discouraging, it must be very very difficult for what was clearly a hardworking man for his whole life to fall to where he is now. And in all likelihood even his internal monologues are disrupted so he can\'t even talk to himself about his many frustrations. Awful stuff, no doubt. But if you are there for him, supporting him, and being kind and loving that\'s the best he can get. Maybe he\'ll get a little more willing, a little less difficult, or maybe not. But he\'s still wounded and scared, and frustration in the room will only amplify those things. Even just quiet time between you and him where you remind him that he is loved, and that everyone is working to help him, is important for the wounded. Maybe a few soft conversations about what you are doing (even if very limited) at home for when he gets there will help see the next step and get him attuned to some work to help with that...but I am least confident speaking about his situation as its just so remote from what I can know about your family.\n    \n    \n\n\nI may think of more, and will throw it on here if I do, but I also welcome any private messages you want to send and will offer any of my experiences that might be useful. \n', 'I am sort of in the same boat. Mom‚Äôs 82 though and had a hemorrhagic stroke on 10 October. She‚Äôs in a skilled nursing place right now and has a fever and I feel that‚Äôs going to hinder her recovery.

I friend told me once that it is true once you've lost neurons, you've lost it, it cannot heal, but the brain is an amassing organ, it will learn to take over the functions it has lost. You can teach it to by doing things your not done before, like using the non dominant hand. I know it sounds cliche but here is what i learnt:\n1. Physical exercise help rebuild the brain neurons. Especially when you get your heart rate up but if you have high blood pressure, do get advice from the doctors. after my first stroke I cycled and kept cycling. Up to 6 hours a day and over 200 km sometimes I was much healthier after 6 months. And I had a lot of my functions back\n2. Diet. One of the issues with my hyper tension is weight. I had to cut weight. Together with cycling I went on a pescetarian diet. Mainly fish and vegetables I cut weight, got my hypertension under control and was about 70% in 9 months\n3. Fish oil supplements. I till ultra strength fish oil with high EPA/dha content, I have read that dha helps with brain development. So I took about 2-4 capsules a day\n\nI was also healthy up to the point I relocated to Europe for work and my hyper tension spiked again and I am going through the same routine I did the last time. So farxi am walking around and I have more strength on my left. I ordered the fish oil and it should arrive next weekend and my bicycles are arriving middle of October. I am planning to get back to that routine to recover. \n\nI totally understand what you are feeling, I am the dad in this case and I am the sole breadwinner and sometimesI don't know who to turn to. Trust me those family visits bring a lot of joy. I see it in other patients too And I am also living on social benefits temporary until I get back to work my personal funds are running low and in a foreign country with no other family around. I transplanted my entire family and I feel disappointed I could make their transition better. I cry sometimes on my walks thinkingthat they should've had a better experience and I was stupid to not recognize the signs and better protected myself\n\nThis is a research paper I've been reading that might be useful for you- https://qbi.uq.edu.au/files/23891/Stroke-research-doc-web.pdf\n"", 'I‚Äôm really sorry for what you are going through.

944,I survived a Catastrophic Stroke 2 1/2 weeks ago and I have horrible survivors guilt.,8,9dobgn,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/9dobgn/i_survived_a_catastrophic_stroke_2_12_weeks_ago/,6,"To be honest, I feel selfish posting this thread... On 8/21, I had a lot of trouble sleeping.  I was mainly in a half-sleep state until I ""felt weird"" and got up around 11:30.  I'm diabetic, and the feeling I had was not unlike what I feel when by blood sugar is dropping.  I got out of bed and stumbled to the living room to test my blood sugar, and found that it wasn't high.  When I commented about that out loud, my speech was very slurred, and I knew I was having a stroke.

I tried to walk back to the bedroom, but instead of stumbling, I was *lurching*. I got my wife to wake up and call 911.  Luckily we live only 2 miles from a level 1 trauma center, and as best as we can calculate, I got tPA right around 1 hour after I had the stroke.  When I got to the ER, I couldn't move anything on the right half of my body, and by the time I got moved up to the Neuro ICU, I was able to move myself from the gurney to the bed.  After a day, the only repercussions I had were very occasional slurring of speech, (It's more pronounced when I'm tired), some very slight fine motor dexterity issues, and emotional fluctuations.  Every doctor, intern and nurse I saw said that they *don't see* recovery like mine until 3-6 months of physical/occupational/speech therapy.

That that's my issue.  I have a hard time accepting that I had a ""Catastrophic Stroke"", and recovered so much in such a small amount of time.  The hospital has a monthly stroke support group and suggested I attend, but I feel like I'd be a fraud walking in there because I made an end-run around the effects that those people deal with every day.  Really, the worst side effect I have is that I'm an emotional roller-coaster.  I get angry easily and cry even more easily.  But even coming here, I see a ton of threads about how to do things with one hand/arm or dealing with limiting weakness, and I feel like I'm being ungrateful because I don't deal with any of that.

I guess I don't even know what I want from posting this.  I just needed to let it all out today.  ",2018-09-06 23:17:35+00:00,"['Congratulations! I‚Äôve heard of people being saved by TPA but yours is the first one I‚Äôve heard first hand.

My hospital roommate was clearly never going to get out of bed- ever. I felt so guilty upon being released. \n\nSupport groups aren‚Äôt my thing either. However, there‚Äôs a Facebook group called called Stroke Survivors that you may find cathartic.\n\nThe best way forward is to continue with your therapy to overcome whatever deficits that you still have, and to live life to its fullest.

You will still be welcome at most support groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe emotional roller coaster is normal. Emotional lability and pseudo-bulbar affect are common stroke impacts.

Thank you for sharing.\n\nAt only 2-1/2 weeks post stroke, I suspect you may still discover some areas that need work besides volatile emotions.  Does your vision check out? can you weak-side wink? Do you Multitask as well as you used to? Brightness, loudness, or sensory overload issues? Self -auditing can be a challenge.\n\nI agree with the other poster, nobody is going to care if you are not struggling as much or as frustrated as many of us because we all know every stroke is different.

I'm about in the same boat you are, I had my stroke about 3 months ago. Unfortunately for mine it happened when I was a asleep, and woke up with the effects not knowing was going on. The main thing I noticed was my left side arm and hand was lagging behind the right. It was probably between when I woke up and till I got to a hospital that knew what they were doing was about 16 hours.   My stroke was caused by complications to the radiation treatment I received as a child. Where the normal person has 4 arteries to the head I got 2 cause they crippled the other two during the radiation treatment from the tumor on the brain stem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the ICU, I went to rehab and tested out of everything.  So I keep them on their toes, I could walk, take a shower, walk out into the hall and go to the courtyard.  After being in the stroke rehab, I did feel a little guilt, being I was no where near as effected by it like some people. It made me more thankful I was not.  After about 2 days of rehab my left hand\\\\arm returned back to normal. So all the effects I feel now is mainly balance, unless I get emotional then my left side really starts to be effected again.  I also can't run, my left leg does not keep up. I can hobble fast, but not run or jog.  I was the same way with the emotions, but It will get better It did for me. I would cry  for no reason and not even know why I was crying."", 'I was drinking wine with a friend when the symptoms hit, so I thought maybe I had one glass too many. I hadn‚Äôt had anything to drink in several weeks and thought I was just being a lightweight. \n\nConsider the Facebook group Stroke Survivors.

Was this an appropriate amount of treatment? \n\nIn ICU: nothing for a week and a half or so, maybe an hour a day in two half hour sessions for the last couple days.\n\nIn rehab hospital: 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week, divided into 4 hour blocks with lunch in the middle.\n\nWas this an appropriate amount? In ICU, yes, I could barely manage that much but it was important to get me started. In rehab: I think this was a bit much, it really wore me out, Many days I found myself looking at the schedule and hoping it was almost over, like a school child watching the clock. I think 5 was fine, days when it was 6 weren\'t so bad, days when it was 8 beat the hell out of me and I didn\'t feel like I was getting much sympathy. \n\n> How long were you in rehab? \n\nA month and a half. By the end of this I was getting seriously stir-crazy and I WANTED TO GO HOME. No accommodation was made for me as a person there: I had *nothing* personal on display in the hospital room, it was utterly colorless and impersonal, all beige, and it was just far enough out of town that my friends couldn\'t visit me after work, like they did when I was in ICU. I needed to get out of that place.\n\n> What would you have liked to change about your treatment?\n\nAs I said, rehab was utterly colorless, and I was sufficiently stroke addled that it just never occurred to me to ask for photos of my friends or family to be brought into the room. Flowers would have been lovely color. Seriously, a month and a half of beige! \n\nThey didn\'t seem to comprehend that I had been on some very serious drugs that were giving me serious delusions and I was trying to fight those off but I did understand reality and I did know that the delusions were delusions. I not only got no sympathy about this, but at one point they started treating me as if I\'d gone mad and this was very distressing. \n\nThey took my driver\'s license away even though when they asked I said explicitly that I had no intention of driving again until my doctors approved it. In fact, I didn\'t *try* to get it back for 10 months after the stroke, and I got clearance from my GP, my cardiologist, my neurologist, and a surgeon before I did, but getting it back was an \\*enormous\\* pain because they\'d taken it away. I actually *begged* them not to do this but they did it anyway.\n\nIn rehab I ended up feeling like I was subject to their every whim and they weren\'t listening to me or taking me seriously. Like. I had problems with nerves in my hands, and they would bring hot and cold bowls of water and place them in my bed with me to dip my hands in... I asked them not to do this, I said the bowls would tip, they insisted on it until a bowl tipped and I pitched a fit. My blood pressure was really low, they wanted to put me in body compression binders to literally squeeze me. I said no, it has to be my medications, a fight of several hours ensued, and I only got my way because I used to work for an insurance company and could quote my rights to them. So I did, it took them about a day to put together the list of my meds and their side effects to read to me (during which time they mostly ignored me), and lo, I was right, it was my meds. They insisted I get up and walk when I was saying ""I can\'t stand up yet"", and they didn\'t listen to me, until one therapist finally listened to me and discovered that my blood pressure was so low that I couldn\'t stand up. Surprise! I eventually stopped feeling ""I should listen to them because they know more than me and I had a stroke so I\'m not thinking well"" and it became ""oh god what are they going to do to me today and do I know enough about my rights to stop them?"" The thing about being a stroke patient is that your brain isn\'t working right and everybody knows it, so nobody takes you seriously and they treat you like a child. But you\'re not a child and you know it, and you\'re used to being an adult and running your own life, and you may understand what\'s going on around you perfectly well but be unable to *say* what you\'re thinking. So it\'s very distressing. \n\nIn theory they understand that you feel tired all the time and they are saying that you need to fight this and do your therapy anyway and suffer though it to get better. In practice, they have absolutely no way to understand *how* exhausted you are all the time, and it would go a long way to making the patient feel they\'re working together instead of adversarial if they would simply let you rest \\*a little\\* more. Even ""okay, you\'ve finished a therapy session, let\'s make sure you have 15 minutes of downtime before your next one"" goes a long way when you\'re exhausted versus ""ok we\'re done now, and oh look, here\'s your next therapist!"" \n\nWhen you\'ve had a stoke you\'re f&$%ing exhausted, but you\'re in a hospital, and they wake you up every hour (or less) all night long to do things like checking your blood pressure or administering medication, and they don\'t seem to realize (or maybe they do but don\'t care) that this makes you so much more exhausted that you literally can\'t go on at some point. I actually got to the point of having to tell my therapists one afternoon ""they kept me up all night long, I am too tired to work with you today."" They once started me on a course of meds that had to be given once an hour for 12 hours a day for 10 days, and they started me at 7pm. I told them that this was exhausting me and begged them to switch me to days, and they more or less told me to suck it up. 8 days into it when I had my ""too tired to continue"" rebellion, they sent a psychiatrist to find out what was wrong with me. After he woke me up I told him what was going on and begged for his help. He spoke to the nurses and they switched my treatments to days, which they\'d been telling me for 8 days was impossible. I felt *very* put-upon for this.\n\nThey wouldn\'t tell me what happened to me even when I asked directly. (When you\'re a stroke victim they don\'t consider you competent, so they don\'t have to tell you.) At some point they told me ""heart attack"", but the only symptoms I could see were for a stroke, so I thought they were lying to me, so I didn\'t trust them. I learned later that they had done an MRI of me which demonstrated that I had had 6 strokes, but they hadn\'t told the rehab about this, and I\'d been sent to a cardiac rehab (I \\*did\\* have a heart attack too), where they thought I *hadn\'t* had a stroke even though it was screamingly obvious. At one point I said something to a nurse about ""the stroke"" and she ran and told a doctor, so I literally ended up with a doctor standing at the foot of my bed screaming at me ""WHAT STROKE, WHO SAID YOU HAD A STROKE?"" (She scared the beejabbers out of me.) I didn\'t actually get confirmation that I had indeed had a stroke for almost 4 months after I got out of the hospital. It would have all been much less stressful if they\'d just told me when I asked them in the first place.  \n', ""When I went to rehab it was maybe after 3 to 4 days in critical care wing of Vanderbilt. They then moved me over to Stallworth rehabilitation center.  I was their for a total of 5 days on scholarship. You got 3 sessions a day (speech, Occupational, and physical)  all lasting an hour long. I think the sessions was the appropriate length almost every time I would go back to the room I would be sweating and would have to shower.   I tested out of the speech therapy, so only had PT and OT daily. I think I challenged them as much as they challenged me, by coming up with some crazy exercises and stuff they wanted me to do.  I do have to say I was probably a very unique case for them. My stroke was caused by an unforeseen consequence of radiation treatment to a tumor on the brain stem.  Leaving me with 2 weekend arteries to the brain instead of the normal 4.  The effects I felt from my stroke was everything on the left side of my body lagged. Like i could think about doing it and then It would happen after a 2 second delay. Maybe after the 2nd day of therapy in the middle of the night I woke up and my left side was moving back to normal again. I still have problems with balance especially at night in the dark\\\\dim room. Other then that I feel like I'm 95 to 99% back to normal.\n\nWould I like to have changed anything about my treatment.

949,Mom had a Stroke - Looking for Advice,7,7mg79z,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/7mg79z/mom_had_a_stroke_looking_for_advice/,13,"Hi Reddit -
Long time lurker, recent commenter and now my first post.

My mother suffered a stroke on Christmas Eve. They are still searching for the source and cause. She‚Äôs had a tough few months. After having had no health issues my entire life, she was in a car accident on October 30th and suffered a broken pelvis. Four weeks later, she fell down the stairs. Now, a stroke.

She was battling some depression prior to the stroke. I‚Äôm afraid it is only going to get worse. She is able to communicate currently but her left side from the shoulder down has little to no mobility or feeling. Her left eye is also being affected and she‚Äôs loosing focus in it. 

My father and I had difficulty getting her to do her PT excercises for the broken pelvis. She also was not eating much or drinking (because she didn‚Äôt want to have to go to the bathroom) previously. The trend seems to be continuing, though she is at least drinking more.

She complains that everything tastes funny. Dad snuck her in some soup yesterday that wasn‚Äôt on her diet plan. She ate about 4oz and that was the most she‚Äôs had since before the stroke.

Survivors, family and friends of survivors, I‚Äôm at a loss. 

How do I help her? How do we keep her eating? How do we keep her doing her therapy? And what do we do about her spirits?

Survivors - what was the thing that helped you the most to stay motivated and positive? What do you wish your family knew prior to the start of your recovery?

I‚Äôve never dealt with anything like this with either parent. And I am looking for any advice and guidance.  Thank you. (And sorry for any wonky formatting - on my mobile) 
",2017-12-27 17:01:04+00:00,"[""Go buy Stronger After Stroke by Peter Levine, it has a wealth of information and I wish I would've read it that early in my recovery "", 'My dad had a stroke about 3 weeks ago. I know it seems scary and in many ways it is life changing for all involved. My advice is to be patient with them, support them by being there and letting them know how proud you are of the things they do, even the small stuff!\n\nIn my experience, time has really made things better. My dad is still going to therapy but he has improved so much in the last few weeks. \n\nHang in there and message me if you wanna talk or know more!', 'Thank you for being there for her in a horrible situation. She\'s already had so much pain and now half her body turns to stone.  I think you are right to focus on being motivated and staying positive, which are two keys to recovery in my book.  I also think you are smart for listening or figuring out her attitude towards food and drink were affected by bathroom difficulties.  As a fall risk, I had to wait for someone to take me to the restroom which I hated. Finding out how the stroke survivor is thinking and figuring out what the difficulties are is important.\nI really appreciated those who told me the truth, that I looked horrible; but had confidence that despite my bad luck, with work I would recover.  Simple touch, quiet optimism and even dark humor all helped. I would guess that she is still shocky and exhausted,  if you can reinforce that you don\'t think she\'s broken, that you aren\'t afraid to touch her, and that with time she will recover. some survivors liked favorite music, others wanted peace and quiet.  I worried about the cognitive tests but wasn\'t too demoralized by left ignore vision issues, it was just one more damn thing to deal with.  The positive energy of in-patient rehab gave me something to focus on and I believed that enough small efforts over time would lead to positive results. i also tried to motivate my therapists to give me their best. Getting her help ""managing"" her care may help motivate and encourage her, as might any show of support from friends and family.\n   Best of luck in her healing and recovery, please let us know how she gets on and if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'So probably someone else will say this, but it\'s important you understand how urgent it is to remember this: every stroke is different. What happened to me will be different from what happened to your mother. I can tell you about my experience, but remember that hers *will* differ.\n\n> Survivors - what was the thing that helped you the most to stay motivated and positive? \n\nVisits from family and friends. Being alone in the hospitals was abject misery. I recognize that they needed time to do therapy and work on me, but damn I was spending day after day, week after week in an environment where the food was always bland and everything (and I mean *everything*) was beige. I would lay there and tell myself ""don\'t kill anybody, three more weeks and you get out of here...""\n\n> What do you wish your family knew prior to the start of your recovery?\n\nI wish they knew then, and I wish they knew *now*, how incredibly *exhausting* it all is. I had to be awake all day for therapy, but if I had any breaks between therapy sessions, I\'d nap. They wanted me sitting up in a chair if I had an hour or two between therapists, but I just wanted to be in bed so I could *sleep*. Not only does a stroke *itself* make you tired, but hospitals don\'t concern themselves with whether they\'re letting you get enough sleep, they concern themselves with other aspects of your treatment... so if they want to give you antibiotics in the middle of the night they do it, and they don\'t *care* if this means they have a nurse bothering you every 2 hours all night long and ensuring you don\'t get any sleep for weeks on end. \n\nAnd then again, the need for sleep it all creates in you can not be underestimated. When I got home from the hospital I was sleeping about 20 hours a day for weeks before it started to get better. I\'d get up, eat, force myself to be upright for maybe an hour, and go back to bed.\n\nOn one hand, I recognize that all these things are *necessary* and while it\'s unfortunate, it\'s important that the stroke victim push themself through this. On the other hand, it would be a hell of a lot better if the family and professionals had a little sympathy and some awareness that sometimes it gets to be too much, and took a more caring tone. I felt (and continue to feel) like my family *just don\'t get it*, they felt (and continue to feel) like I\'m just being lazy and that any lingering physical or mental problems from it all are my fault for not working hard enough. (I\'m making it sound like it\'s worse than it is, but I have had some of these kinds of remarks from them.) \n\nAnd in the hospitals they would just push me and push me until I (repeatedly) broke down crying because I literally hadn\'t slept in days and couldn\'t handle it any more, and then they\'d *finally* recognize that maybe they\'d pushed me too far again and *somebody* would intervene and they\'d give me a little rest. \n\nAn example: At one point they needed to give me some antibiotics that had to be administered 12 hours a day for 2 weeks, and this involved bothering me every couple hours to give me another dose and/or check on how I\'m doing. So of course, they started this at 8pm, meaning they\'d be bothering me every couple hours *all night long*. On day one I asked if they couldn\'t do this in day time instead of night, but they more or less ignored me. (One of the frustrating parts of being a stroke victim is everyone assumes you\'re either incompetent or crazy and ignores everything you say, *even when you\'re right*.) I begged them *every day* to please switch it to daytimes, but they kept ignoring me. On maybe day 11 of 14 I hadn\'t had a solid night\'s sleep in 12 days and completely freaked out at them when they tried to drag me off to *yet another* therapy session when I was just *too damned tired* to cope. I *finally* got them to send an actual *doctor* to talk to me (I\'d see nurses and therapists day after day but a doctor only maybe weekly), and I somehow managed to come up with enough words to explain the problem to him. (When you\'ve had a stroke, it can be very difficult to talk. You know what you mean, but the words just aren\'t there for you to say it.) He basically ordered that they give me a dose *now* and then let me sleep through the night and switch it to days... like I\'d been begging them to do for 11 days and they\'d been telling me was impossible. One word from him and they did it.\n\n> How do I help her? How do we keep her eating? How do we keep her doing her therapy? And what do we do about her spirits?\n\nThere\'s really only one question here: how do you get her spirits up enough for her to want to eat and do therapy?\n\nThe answer is, she has to find that in herself. You can help her find where to look, but unless she self motivates she won\'t make the effort, and if she doesn\'t make the effort she\'s going to be spending the rest of her life in a nursing home. Or she\'ll die of starvation.\n\nSo give her the carrot and the stick. \n\nThe carrot is that if she works hard and does her therapy and improves enough she may get some independence back, she won\'t have to rely on these people to do everything for her any more. (Trust me, having to call and beg for a bed pan when you need to go and hoping they actually show up before you make a mess in your bed gets real frustrating real fast.) She may get to drive herself to McDonalds and have a hamburger. She may get to get up and walk around whenever she likes. She may get to have a piece of candy. She may get to take a shower. She may get to cook her own breakfast. She may get to sit in the front row at your wedding. She may get to hold her first grandchild in her arms. She may get to use the toilet again and wipe her own bum. (This was a big deal for me. I said it was my actual goal when they moved me into the rehab hospital, and the doctors were *shocked* that I had a realistic goal.) \n\nThe stick is that if she *doesn\'t* work herself hard to do her therapy she will probably not improve enough to get her independence back, she will probably spend the rest of her life in professional care, and the rest of you will sooner or later have to return to your daily lives and, while you will still love her and visit her when you can, that won\'t be all the time any more - she won\'t be able to monopolize all of your time forever, so she\'ll find herself feeling very alone at a hospital all the time. \n\nAnd if she doesn\'t start eating regularly, she\'ll *die*. And then she won\'t live to see you marry or have kids. And you should in fact put it to her that bluntly. Ask her if she is going to start eating regularly or if she is going to tell you what color casket you need to put her in. Don\'t let her choose to do neither: pester her to make a choice and tell you. And if she says she\'s going to eat, watch her do it and ask the staff to please let you know if she starts declining food again) and if she starts to ignore the food again start to bother her about the casket color again. Should it be brown or black on the outside? Should the lining be white or pink or blue? What clothes do you want to be buried in? Do you want a burial or a cremation? Oh you don\'t want to talk about this? Well too bad, I\'m going to keep pestering you until you answer or you eat. Pick. Now is the casket brown or black? (Don\'t be afraid to cry as you demand answers. She needs to see it\'s about more than just her.)\n\nAnd remember, she may just say ""the casket should be brown with a white lining, bury me in my powder blue pants suit, and it should be a burial."" If she does that it means she has *decided* she *wants* to give up and die. At that point you can start telling her how selfish that is if you want to.\n\nA big thing that kept me going was knowing how deeply it had freaked out my father, hearing from my aunt how she\'d had to talk to him for 45 minutes before he could even cope with the knowledge of how bad I was, that he\'d run around in a panic packing a bag so he could rush to my side. I knew I had to live if only so my dad didn\'t have to bury his only child. He has had too much pain in his life, I couldn\'t give him this on top of it. I couldn\'t bear the thought of putting him through my death, or making him see me spend the rest of my days in a nursing home while he walked around free. So while I hated every minute, I *forced* myself through therapy, I *forced* myself to endure it all, I *forced* myself to walk and talk again, I *forced* myself to have enough independence that I could let him return to his life and stop worrying so much. And let me tell you, I *did* have to endure pain and suffering and fear and exhaustion, and I *did* eventually have to start taking control of my own destiny and saying ""no"" to therapists and nurses when they pushed too far. It was no picnic, and it will be worse for your mother because I wasn\'t as bad off as her. \n\n', ""First, let me tell you how sorry I am that you and your family are going through this. I can fully empathize with your situation. My mother had a stroke in August and my dad died in October. It sucks. \n\nI have had to pick up so many pieces of my mother's life and I literally have no idea what I am doing. I would encourage you to keep a journal. Date the top of the entry and write a small passage about how she's doing each day. Note any changes, setbacks, and/or accomplishments. Note any medications (names of meds and what they are prescribed for) and how often she takes them. I'd also encourage you to be patient with her and let her find her own words. I brought my mother coloring books and fat crayons. I played tic-tac-toe with her. I brought her ice cream and french fries even though I knew these were bad for her. I just wanted her to get better.\n\nI had to figure out all of her accounts and pay her bills. I've had to call companies and speak on her behalf. I do not have power of attorney but I do my best to convince people to help me.  \n\nWe are four months down and she is better than she was. The doctors say in 8 months, we will be amazed. I hope so. It is hard to see her cry and struggle but it is also rewarding to see strides. She had lost the ability to read and write but, just last week, she read Star Wars on the movie marquee (old timey, brightly lit).\n\nI am not a professional and cannot offer medical advice. I would just tell you to take it one day at a time.\n\nAs for me, I plan on leaving a thumb drive in my documents with all of my information in spreadsheet form. I will entrust my oldest child with this information and ask her to guide the other siblings. I will be watching my diet and exercising/staying fit. I need to make sure that I go to checkups and take care of myself. I do not want my children to have to go through this with me.\n\nGood luck, friend."", 'Hi, Neuro Speech Pathologist here. Just wanted to flag something re the soup your dad snuck in! Some people post stroke have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúdysphagia‚Äù, also known as difficulty with eating and drinking. If your mum has any difficulty eating and drinking post stroke, a speech pathologist would be involved to modify the consistency of her food and drinks. We know families mean well by bringing in food, but if food and drink that isn‚Äôt recommended is brought in, it can be aspirated (go down the air way) and cause a nasty chest infection.\n\nIf your mum‚Äôs swallowing is not affected, then no harm done! However, if there are swallowing changes I recommend asking your speechie about what food and drinks might be suitable for you to bring in from home (ps they normally have some good ideas on how to modify normal foods!)\n\nRegarding the changing of taste of foods: the nerves that similarly innervate swallow function are also responsible for the sensation to our tongue (taste!). When these nerves are affected through stroke, sometimes our taste buds can change too. It will be a bit of trial and error and this will probably resolve in time\n\nIn terms of motivation for therapy/rehab, I find that acknowledging their difficulties is the first step to encouragement. Then, some simple reminders about things they use to love and do with their mobility/communication/swallowing are great (i.e ‚Äúlet‚Äôs work on our reading today so you can work towards reading the daily newspaper independently again‚Äù) -these are speech examples but same can be applied to physio for walking/travelling/social outings etc', ""After my stroke I had a taste problem as well. At first I think it was a combination of the stroke and a water pill I was taking and then ultimately it was just the water pill because my taste came back a few weeks after the Doctor said I could stop taking it.\n  \nIt wasn't just that things tasted bland, but rather that eating was unpleasant. I think the water pill was giving me a dry mouth which made food much harder to chew and swallow. The only food I could enjoy was soup, especially one that was very flavorful. I ended up going out for a big bowl of Pho every week. I also enjoyed eating hot cheetos because the spice and oil made them easy to chew/swallow and taste but I doubt they're a good idea until she recovers more."", 'I had a car accident in Aug 14, 2008.

953,Strokes are cruel,7,6kddv3,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/6kddv3/strokes_are_cruel/,8,"Hi, i am a 49 year old male. Had a few strokes at one time (4 of them) in February. A few weeks before my 49th birthday, so i was 48 at the time.

The more l learn about stroke, the worse I understand it could have been. After relentless hours of reading (and videos). A stroke is like a coin toss, Heads is Death / Tails is Brain Damage, and you do not get to call it. It is what it will be. 

A month ago or so, I couldn't type, talking was a task. But yes, with time, these things are coming back. But not all comes back, at least i don't think it does. Here is how i see the stroke and healing process.

My life, and who I am is built with Lego blocks. As i learn and live, more blocks are added. One day, a stroke comes along, and smashes down the blocks. You live, but as the blocks are put back together, you feel as though some are missing. What ones are missing, not really sure, I just know, some are missing.

I feel guilty of complaining in anyway after seeing how some are left (my hospital stay). And part of me, wants me all back (is that greedy). I am treated different by Family and Friends. Not bad in anyway, but enough of me is here to notice a difference.
I had a voice that would stop the (kids, pets), and sometimes the wife in there tracks. Now i have a voice that is ignored and laughed at.
I am numb on one half of my body. And I mean half, you could draw a line down the center of me. My left arm, feels like a broken tree branch that is attached to me, but doesn't feel like mine. It does what i want most of the time.

My Wife has been the greatest. I could not have come this far without her. 

I had so much to say when i started this, but have become tired and making to many typing errors now. I'll get back to this soon. ",2017-06-30 03:15:00+00:00,"[""Your stroke sounds similar to minds, I was paralyzed on my right side straight down the middle. I have full movement now but terrible sensation. I cant feel what I touch.  Plus right side weakness. Leg snaps back. Im in constant pain as well. Continue to strengthen as much as possible so your muscles won't get tight over time and stretch as much as possible.  Your feelings are normal and extremely relatable . It's a big adjustment. I'm 2 years out and still struggling to accept things how they are. I have a hard time accepting improvements because in my mind it hasnt brought me back to who i was so i feel them to be useless even though i know it counts. The struggle is real and the journey to get back to who you were is terrifying because you dont know if you'll ever get there and that in itself is what makes it so difficult. I feel like I've robbed my family of a better life. I can see the need they have for me though so I don't give up even though I want too.  Your wife is very supportive and that's great. Your young, keep fighting and pushing to improve. easier said than done, I knowüòí but from one stroke victim to the next we are all dealing with this and we need to hear this from each other.this goes for the caretakers as well as their struggles with this are difficult too. Looking forward to reading the rest of your thoughts. "", 'There are a lot of us out here that can relate to your thoughts.\n\nCome back and keep relaying those thoughts to all of us.

I\'m not totally alone.\n\nThat video posted on here ""it\'s still me"", I cried like never before watching it. I cried typing that sentence. How bad it could have been, how it is for so many. Strokes are so cruel.', 'Firstly, welcome, and I\'m sorry to hear about your strokes.\n\nI had somewhere between 1 and 6 strokes in December 2015 (the MRI is genuinely unclear, although I suspect the real answer is ""more than 1""). \n\nI really know what you mean about ""My left arm, feels like a broken tree branch that is attached to me, but doesn\'t feel like mine. It does what i want most of the time."" My strokes initially affected both hands, but quickly settled down on my left hand as the right healed. My middle finger and my pointer finger didn\'t feel like part of my body for months. Even after I regained motion of them, they felt like they were sticks stuck in my hand and covered with wax - they didn\'t feel like part of my body, and the surrounding fingers didn\'t recognize them as fingers. I constantly had feelings of ""AAAAA! What are these *things* sticking out of my hand?"" \n\nI kept gently exercising them (open and close while looking at them, gently use my other hand to move them if I can\'t move them, watch while doing it so the eyes can reinforce the movement in the brain) and slowly, with time, the ""foreign object attached to my body"" feeling faded, even if the fingers are still kinda numb. (I can\'t use them for typing and you have no idea how many typos I\'ve stopped to correct in this text so far.) \n\nThere was no definitive ""this day they didn\'t feel like fingers, but the next day they did"", the weird feeling just faded with time and exercise. \n\n> My Wife has been the greatest. I could not have come this far without her.\n\nPeople have both positive and negative experiences with the people around them. I\'m glad that yours, like mine, in this respect is positive. My boyfriend dumped me, but my friends came out of the woodwork to be helpful and shocked the heck out of my family by how they organized everything. \n\n> I feel guilty of complaining in anyway after seeing how some are left (my hospital stay).\n\nYour stroke is *your* stroke and my stroke is mine. You can only live your own life. It\'s okay to recognize that there are people much worse off than you (let me take a moment to recognize that you\'re worse off than me) while still feeling bad about what happened to you. A stroke is an awful thing and no one should have to experience it. \n\n>  And part of me, wants me all back (is that greedy). \n\nNo. We all want our lives back. The key part is not to suppress that, but to recognize ""okay, things are different now, I have different challenges to cope with, I will face my *new* difficulties and fight my *new* battle and maybe with some luck I can get some part of myself back."" In other words, don\'t feel bad about wishing you had yourself back, but try to *begin* to accept your current situation so you can deal with it. I don\'t mean accepting that your body isn\'t working right so it will never work right and you have to suffer, I mean accepting the *fact* of your body not working, and recognize that this fact *means* you\'re going to have to work on it. \n\nWhile I was laying in bed in ICU, my father droned on at me about how his grandfather had a stroke at the age of 90 and was paralyzed and numb on one side, and he got no therapy (it was 1970, they thought that if an old person had a stroke it was just a sign they were going to die, so they did nothing) but worked his own body back to being fully functional and made a complete recovery. (He said this to inspire me, and I kept my mouth closed about how much pressure he was putting on me and that his grandfather got drunk and drove off a cliff with a snowmobile in the middle of the night two years later, but I hope you see my point that *maybe* a full recovery is possible for you. Never give up.) \n\n> I am treated different by Family and Friends. Not bad in anyway, but enough of me is here to notice a difference. \n\nYup. And it will take a few years for people to learn to knock off the ""talking to you like a child"" routine. People are acutely aware that *something happened to your brain* and they *know* that occasionally things you do and say will be just *wrong* in some way. Because they *saw* it happen earlier in your recovery. (All my friends and family came and saw me in ICU with tubes coming out of my nose and throat and my privates hanging out for all the world to see, as I was unconscious. After that I figure they\'ve earned the right to be disrespectful to me for a little while.) I know it sucks, but bite the bullet and accept that you\'ve just gone through a period of your brain not working right (from the strokes, from the drugs, whatever) and they saw it, and you\'re going to have to cope a while with them acting like a child until they can see you have control of your brain again. \n\n> I had a voice that would stop the (kids, pets), and sometimes the wife in there tracks. Now i have a voice that is ignored and laughed at.\n\nYou need to communicate to those around you *who will listen* that when you\'re treated like that (by them or others) it makes you feel both angry and hurt, and that you know that  you\'re not the person you once were but this disrespect is very painful and it must stop if those people who are giving it to you are to remain part of your life.\n\nI know from painful experience that after a stroke it\'s really hard to express yourself, especially to communicate needs to people around you. That\'s okay. Take your time, compose your thoughts, and then talk to your wife about it. It you don\'t feel confident in expressing it, show her this message. \n\n>  I am numb on one half of my body. And I mean half, you could draw a line down the center of me.\n\nThat is, unfortunately, a fairly common symptom. ', 'Strokes are assholes, pants fall down in public and if you reach for them you know you\'ll fall. I had an extended ischemic that started with weakness and changed to paralysis of the left side because both strokes and fate are assholes..

A neurologist at Cincinnati's Jewish hospital told me that rehab was the only way to return functionality, at which point rehab became my ""little engine that could"" goal.  along the way I was surprised to find out how rarely client's thank their rehab team for their time, energy and expertise.  Sure, insurance is probably paying someWone but why would anyone be rude to the experts whom they are relying on to put them back together? What I consider to be common courtesy is to acknowledge that your therapists have gone to school forever and are trying every trick in the book to help you walk or talk again.  Saying ""Thank You"" should not be ashock to the rehab team.  The fact that every client of theirs were not saying thank you, everyday is a shame.Yes, strokes are not fair and you are scared and often in pain but your very best chance of fighting back are the therapists helping you stand or hanging on to you gait belt.

I have no noticeable physical symptoms left and I never lost my language or had any impaired memory. 
What I'm left with is fatigue and more difficulty concentrating, which leads to getting tired faster and recovering slower. When I'm tired I start yawning like crazy. If I don't rest it will always lead to crying. I cry about anything. Any emotion sets it off. I also get irritable and often yell at people without good reason. Afterwards I regret it and cry. 

The problem is that I seem completely ""normal"" as long as I stay rested. No one can see that I have a damaged area in my brain.  

What I really want to know is - if there are others like me out there - how do you deal with the expectations from yourself and others in your daily life? 
How do you talk to your partner about being to tired to make dinner every day of the week? How do you handle coworkers who expect you to be able to handle the same amount of work as them? 
How do you let your boss know you can't make it to work because you're just too tired one morning?
How do you adjust your own expectations so you don't take on too much and end up disappointed and overwhelmed? That is actually my biggest problem. Hope you've got some good stories and helpful advice :) ",2017-03-04 23:03:07+00:00,"['I had a stroke in March of 2013. I\'ve found that, since then, I\'ve needed way more sleep than I used to just to power through the work week. If I stay up too late too many nights or push myself too far, there will inevitably a day I call ""zombie day"" where I just go through the motions until I can fall into bed by 6 PM to wake up again by 6 AM. Sometimes I need that recovery sleep because I honestly feel like I\'m functioning at about 10%.    \nThe hardest thing for me is dealing with an ""invisible"" problem. I sometimes wished I had a broken bone or something that people could see and say, ""Oh! That\'s terrible! That must be really hard!"". With a neurological issue, people don\'t know how to react, or sometimes they just think you\'re faking it. I even had doctors accuse me of having a mental health issue rather than a neurological issue. I am definitely doing a lot better and, what helped me, was just being open about it. Most people have no real understanding of what a stroke is. They don\'t know what happens, how it happens, or what the after effects are. Share the information, and be as open as you are comfortable with others. Anytime my friends, family, or colleagues have expressed concerns about something stroke-related, I just tell them that I have a broken brain. It\'s healing but it\'s not quite at full capacity. You wouldn\'t tell someone with two broken arms to start playing piano, so don\'t push me to do something I\'m not yet capable of doing. I\'m still myself, but I\'m healing. ', '[deleted]', 'I am sorry that you are going through this and I empathize with your situation! \n\nMy stroke occurred late October of last year and I returned to work (part time) at the beginning of February. Because I work in a hospital, people are more familiar with what a stroke is, however, I am younger than most of the stroke patients we see and as a result people do not know how to respond. (I am 34 now and many of our patients are in their late 60s at least!)\n\nUnless I am tired - I guess the term is neuro-fatiuge, most are unable to tell I have had a stroke. I walk and talk fine, eat, drink and act like any other 34 year old. There are effects that remain from the stroke, other than the brain damage, but they aren\'t terribly visible. \n\nThe way I have dealt with this is to joke about it to EVERYONE that I interact with somewhat regularly. Once we get past the initial shock and the comment ""you look good/fine"" is made, I respond with something like ""I don\'t look like I had a stroke you mean?"" I then don\'t avoid it in normal conversation - if I am tired I say that I am stroke-tired and need to nap. Reduced concentration/focus and irritability (esp when tired) is an issue but again, I just joke about it. I have reduced feeling on my right side with an almost inability to feel temperature on that side, so doing things that may cause some discomfort with someone who can feel temperature - I say let me, (unjam that rather warm copy machine, take the dog out in the sub-zero weather), I can\'t feel it thanks to the stroke and so might as well put it to use! Obviously, I am careful not to injure myself. My hands are no longer as dexterous as they once were, they shake, sometimes to the point that I can\'t pick anything up. I joke about that as well when it happens and it seems to do the trick of putting people at ease (bc I clearly am not super bothered by it) and it acknowledges that I am not 100% (yet). \n\nAgain, because I work in the hospital setting I don\'t run into people who do not know what a stroke is or what it can do. However, I find myself trying to prove to people that I am not helpless. There seems to be a fine line between getting the help/understanding you need and being completely useless as a person.  Before the stroke I was up for a promotion that took 8yrs of training and may not get it as the administration, who doesn\'t know me, just sees STROKE VICTIM and assumes I am not up for the task.

It's been 3 days since he got out of ICU. (Left-sided stroke, right side paralysis, still has edema in his brain.) 

Which aphasia he has has not been diagnosed yet, but I think it may be Broca's aphasia.  He mostly understands us but cannot speak, states that he ca read a little with difficulty, and I think he couldn't recognize numbers.  We can overcome these, but there is another problem in our communication during this period.  He makes the same hand gesture to tell everything.  He opens and closes his fingers and thinks he says it all.  He gets angry when we don't understand. We asked him if he could point his thumb towards his mouth when he asked for water, he shaked his head as no. When he wants me to switch the channel, he holds my chin and turns my head to the television, instead of just pointing the TV. Same thing with room temperature. He's not even pointing his stomach if he gets hungry.

After 3 months I decided I needed to work especially to get medical coverage again,  But even though many places said they had no problem that I had a stroke no places called me back.  In April I was finally able to get a minimum wage job at the airport collecting luggage carts.   On the plus side, I was really happy that I got a job, and I got a lot of exercise walking about 30k steps a day, on the negative side, I felt really depressed as I felt that this would be my lot in life for the rest of my life.  About a year and a half later, I was able to get a job as a bureaucrat with the State,   It was still a fairly basic job, but I felt a bit better for it.  So the big question.  why didn't I go back to a startup?  After the stroke, especially a few months after a stroke, and up to a year afterwards, I didn't feel mentally strong enough.  After about a year, I felt much stronger mentally, but even now I know that I'm not totally mentally ok, yet.  I'm slower.  Some simple tasks such as memorization and speed as in thinking quickly I'm significantly worse.

According to my limited knowledge of sleep, and again, I am not a doctor, he needs to discuss with his doctor, because if there is not an underlying condition to his sleepless nights, like racing heart, or something else he may just need a prescription to sleep. Also be extra patient, as you're likely familiar with yourself on too little sleep, irritability, memory issues, decreased or increased appetite, he is likely experiencing all those things but compounded and exacerbated by his brain hemorrhage. Ultimately, one of the only solutions to sleep issues on that scale is medication, which can be attained through a sleep study and a sleep doctor. Which are multiple, often time consuming, steps.

So I took my Father to the doctor when he was calmed down, he had his psychosis medication changed from Quetiapine to Olanzapine.

She now has right side negligence, cannot walk without assistance and has lost the ability to read, or figure out the words she needs to describe something. For a stroke, she's better than most. But the downside she refuses therapy whether physical or occupational. She refuses mental therapists of any kind. And now expects me to do everything for her. 

Such as in her impulse she's forced me to the grocery store 3 times this week because she can't formulate what she wants before shopping begins. And subsequently won't go to the store with me because it tires her out too much. Only for me to walk in the door, tell me what I got was wrong and now we have to go back tomorrow because she wants baby powder (??) And sweet tarts. 

I'm at a loss. She expects me as her child to care for her but if I'm stuck caring for her every whim.

I thought it was worthwhile to follow up on that in a separate post with a picture! 

[u/lak2158](https://www.reddit.com/u/lak2158/) mentioned, there is right neglect but it is rare. The reason is that the left side of our brain processes the visual arousal and attention of the right side. However, the right side of our brain, for whatever reason, processes BOTH left and right side visual arousal and attention.

So if there is a lesion in the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere just takes over since it processes BOTH left and right visual arousal and attention. However, if a lesion happens in the right hemisphere, it takes out the only area perceiving visual arousal and attention on the left side. This is why left neglect is much more common!

993,OT Tip: B is for...,7,n4nwbh,stroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/n4nwbh/ot_tip_b_is_for/,0,"**B is for... Blood Pressure.** (Ya'll knew that one was coming!)

Chronically elevated blood pressure causes the walls of our arteries to weaken, narrow, and become damaged. This can cause a greater opportunity for a clot to form (leading to ischemic stroke) or a blood vessel to rupture (leading to a hemorrhagic stroke). Chronic high blood pressure is one of the primary causes of hemorrhagic strokes.

Think about a garden hose. Do you ever put your thumb over the end to make the stream stronger? That‚Äôs kind of what happens in our blood vessels when we have high blood pressure. It takes a lot more force to squeeze liquid through a narrowed space.

Raised blood pressure puts a strain on the heart muscle, too. The heart has to pump more often and harder due to the need to push blood through the narrowed arteries.

While genetics, race, and ethnicity (things you can't change) play a role in developing high blood pressure, there are still modifiable risk factors you can work on. 

If you‚Äôre on blood pressure-lowering medications, don‚Äôt stop taking them unless your doctor changes something.

The factor with the most impact you can change is diet: specifically to cut back sodium (salt) in your diet. 

**Why?**

At a chemical level, water always follows salt.

When you over-consume salt, an excess amount of water follows that salt into your blood vessels. This extra fluid in your blood vessels causes increased blood pressure. If you're thinking about changing your diet to decrease sodium intake, check out[ the DASH diet](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456) or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension to get some ideas.",2021-05-04 13:06:56+00:00,[],994

‚Äã  
We are just a day away from May, which happens to be National Stroke Awareness Month in the United States.  
‚Äã  
To honor that, I released a new YouTube video that provides a simple overview of what a stroke actually is and covers the 4 main types of strokes. Unfortunately, I've heard from too many survivors who didn't receive this necessary education while they were in the hospital or couldn't comprehend it right after their stroke happened.

Everyone should have access to health-related information that pertains to them, especially in the case of a life-changing issue. Information is power and helps us advocate for ourselves.

Started out completely numb on his left arm but after a few weeks got some sensation back but not completely. 

It isn‚Äôt so much numbness as it is that sometimes he feels things too intensely (more often) or not intensely enough (less often). 

For example, the cat stepping on his arm can feel like a crushing weight, a light brush of a finger can feel like scrapping, cold can feel like intense burning, etc...

Any tips on how to improve his sensation? All the advice/techniques I find are for numbness and would cause him pain (I think).

In a stroke context, allodynia can come after an injury to the thalamus. At an extreme, it may be known as Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. The typical course is for it to emerge several weeks post-stroke. \n\nAllodynia can be tough to treat, but there *are* treatments. Everyone who has had a stroke should have a neurologist, and the neurologist is the person to ask.', ""I have that on my leg- a big 'dead patch' that absolutely \\*aches\\* when it gets touched.\n\n  \nI have no idea. :( If you find out, please let me know."", ""After my stroke, I had a couple fingers of my left hand that, if anything touched the tips, it felt like I was being stabbed in those fingers. This was a problem, because I had to sleep with them outside of the blanket so they wouldn't touch sheets and wake me, but I also needed them to be in the blankets so they wouldn't get cold from poor circulation. They also ached all over all the time, and while that interfered with my sleep, it didn't make me scream. My therapists suggested I desensitize them and gave me sandpaper to touch with them, but I didn't use it much because it hurt like hell to touch anything. My neurologist gave me gabapentin. \n\nFive years later I am still on gabapentin, and the doctor says I can continue taking it. I no longer get the stabbing sensation if I forget my gabapentin and touch anything, but they continue to ache if I don't take it."", ""Hi! I'm an occupational therapist and this is something that we work on quite regularly, and something that we can see improvements with! So if talking to the neurologist doesn't bring about anything productive, you could seek out a stroke/neuro occupational therapist for assessment and treatment! I don't know where you're located, but sometimes you need a doctor's referral to work with an occupational therapist. Certain physios, especially those who are trained in stroke/neuro might be able to work on this as well. Depending what country you're in and if you have private insurance coverage you could look into whether you have coverage for one or the other, or both.  If you don't have access to this type of professional then I would recommend checking out some reputable websites that can give you more information about treating these problems. In the business we tend to call this sensory reeducation or sensory retraining. The goal would be finding a stimulus that only elicits a very minor response and then building up tolerance from there. An example of very gentle stimuli might be touching a Kleenex or room temperature water. I do not recommend forcing him to endure pain, that can just exaggerate the already inappropriate response. Sensation is very complex and this is the kind of thing that is best addressed after a thorough sensory evaluation. We have different nerves that respond to different stimuli, some for pain some for temperature, some for vibration, etc etc And there can be several different ways that they change after a stroke. Great that his numbness has improved, and good to start working with a professional as soon as possible!

He has lost a lot of mobility in his right side, but he is improving.  He is able to feed himself, he's on a blended foods only diet atm, because he's had issues swallowing.  He has some aphasia as well, and struggles to communicate.  We basically stick to yes/no questions and for the moment but we are hoping he regains his ability to speak.  He can speak, but it seems difficult for him.  

He also has T1 diabetes.  I've been noticing he has MUCH better days when his blood sugar is lower, I think normal for him is around 200-250.

The doctor told us today that he's still at 100% assistance and I think that means he can't walk, use the bathroom, speak yet.  He's having physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy 5 days a week.  2 days ago he was able to sit up on his own!  I'm encouraged by all of that, but he's only going to be there for 3 weeks maximum, because that's all the insurance will allow. 

I'm hoping for some help with diet and any recommendations about that.  My sister and I are convinced if he sticks to a Mediterranean diet, higher fats from healthy sources, lower carbs and high in fruits and vegetables, he'd have a better shot at a good recovery.  He's always loved diet soft drinks and red meat, we're hoping cutting those out will improve his prospects too.

My mother had massive stroke when she was 36 years old. I was 4 and it has been 25 years since it happened. It completely turned our lives upside down both financially and emotionally. It was a long road back, but she worked hard and never gave up. The doctors originally told my father she would be in a wheelchair the rest of her life and her speech would never return. That doctor was wrong she persevered and began driving about 2 years later. She has no use of her right arm and walks with a limp, and can speak albeit not with much frustration due to aphasia. 

Growing up I didn't realize what I was missing in my mother. It was not until I met my wife that I really realized how traumatic the event was for me as a child. The general attitude and front presented by father was to never talk about it and pretend nothing changed, but the reality was everything had changed. I lost a mother I hardly new as a 4 year old. In depth conversation, comfort, and advice that would generally be given couldn't be communicated anymore. I find myself 25 years later grieving who my mother was before her stroke and the relationship we would have had. I see her as a pillar of strength and a loving mother, but seeing my wife and her mother, I now realize how much I have missed out on. I recently lost my grandmother to a stroke and it seems to have brought up feelings about my mothers stroke and my childhood that I had never realized, and it is taking a toll on me.
