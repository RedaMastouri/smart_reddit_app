I’m not ready.,632,9isza1,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9isza1/im_not_ready/,82,"In 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. 

Ewing’s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. 
I named her Shannon. 

So because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. 

I did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. 

It was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn’t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i’m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. 

Halfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn’t much of a bother. I couldn’t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn’t have made it down there that night, I would have died. 

So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. 

I did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there’s never a certain “you’re cancer free” with Ewings) January this year. I’d won. 
During my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. 

And then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. 
I lit up EVERYWHERE. 

I had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. 
There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. 
It was official. I’m terminal. 

There’s no way to stop it, and I’m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. 

I’m dying. I’m 17 - 18 in a few months. I’m not ready to die. I can’t. I can’t leave my family and friends behind. 

My mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She’s everything I could ever hope to be and I’m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can’t do that to her. 

I’ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can’t leave her either. We promised we’d grow old together. We promised we’d spoil each other’s kids. 

And then there’s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I’m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won’t be able to do that. He’s 12 for Christ’s sake he can’t lose his sister. I can’t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he’s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. 

And my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I’m hers. She looks up to me and I can’t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. 
And now I can’t. 

I’ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I’ll never see them get married. I’ll never meet their kids. 

And the worst part is that they’re all so young that they’re gonna forget me. 
For the 12 year old, he’ll remember me, but over the years it’s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we’ve fought or played or bickered. He won’t remember my mannerisms or the times we’d spend hanging out in my room. 
And the babies won’t remember anything about me. That’s what’s breaking my heart. 
All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won’t remember anything. I’ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. 

I can’t leave my family behind. I just can’t do it. I’m not ready. 

And my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn’t anymore (thanks to the radiation). The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. 
I’m not going to have her anymore. And again, I’ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. 

I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. But I don’t have a choice. 

My doctor said he’d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That’s 2 months. 
2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. 
I’m not ready. Please god please I just don’t want to die. 

I just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I’m sorry. It’s 1am and everyone’s asleep, and I didn’t want to burden my mum by letting her know I’m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. 


***UPDATE*** 
So I’m still here, as you can tell. I’ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn’t been easy - but I’m okay. 
I’m doing well actually (head wise, at least). Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. 
I’ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. 

I’ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it’s been out of action for about a week now, but i’m slowly recovering. 
I’ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren’t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen’s help - it just wouldn’t be too fun. 

Otherwise... I’ve really been okay. (Just don’t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao)
We all know my time’s coming, but if the time since I’ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I’ve got my family and friends behind me. 

I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. 

Here’s to this not being my last update, either!

A few days ago the hospital oncologist gave me the bad news that my cancer had spread to my lungs. Also that I had a swollen lymph node in the groin that was perceived to be cancerous. 

So yeah I have a 3-5 months if I were to do chemo except I’d be locked away in the hospital with no visitors. The other option is to not take any treatment go into hospice and live for about 2-4 months. We’ve opted for the latter because I wanted to be able to see family before I die. 

It’s been hard the past few days to process this option but we are happy with the decision and are planning for a lot of visits. I’m excited to meet old and new friends I hadn’t met before. It’s a blessing that I didn’t anticipate but it brings me so much joy that’ll I’ll be meeting these people before I go.

Anyways I could go on but I’ll keep this shortish r/cancer I love y’all and thanks for the laughs and support throughout my entire journey.

"Diagnosed in June, Dead in August",438,cuo28h,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/cuo28h/diagnosed_in_june_dead_in_august/,49,"My wonderful husband was diagnosed with cancer in June. In August we did 10 days of radiation. Then Monday, August 19, we took him to see the surgeon about having a port placed for chemo. We knew the cancer had spread to many areas, but the oncologist thought that chemo would help extend his life. He couldn't stand up long enough to get from the car to the wheelchair. We had to get staff from the surgeon's office to help us get him into the wheelchair and into the doctor's office. The surgeon looked at him and sent us to the ER.

The ER staff moved us from a regular room to the trauma room. They found fluid around his heart. A few minutes after they went in to drain it, people started running into and out of the room. Literally running, not just walking fast. They got him somewhat stabilized and told us that we needed to get him to a hospital in the city (about 90 min by car). It was a rotten way to get a helicopter ride, and I am sure he didn't even get to enjoy it. The hospital had to intubate him to give him pain meds. He had been moaning and whining when they tried to drain the fluid from his heart. We heard it from outside the rood. So having him sent by air ambulance to the city was NOT good news. If it had just been his heart, his cardiologist could have handled it at the hospital at home. But his kidneys were not working, and we don't have a kidney doc at out hospital.

By the time I got to the hospital, he was in the ICU. The nurses and doctors were AMAZING. So caring, and not just about him. I finally managed to get away to find a hotel at about midnight. The next few days were a whirl of hospital, hotel, my mom and kids coming up to visit and/or stay, and my inlaws and his sister coming to visit. It was awful but also good.

On Wednesday we decided to let him go on Thursday afternoon. He and I had our 28th anniversary on the 10th, and on the 22nd I had to say goodbye. It just is so awful and painful.

After they took the tubes out, our sons read him to sleep. He spent many years reading stories to them, complete with all the voices. So our boys got a copy of one of my husband's favorite book series for kids (Hank the Cowdog) and they read until the end. It was the sweetest thing I have ever seen them do. One of the most loving things they could have done.",2019-08-24 03:00:29+00:00,10,"                                                 body

It’s over,437,l2093s,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/l2093s/its_over/,80,"Im (F32) in bed next to my beautifull gorgeous sweet sweet husband . He’s home with me and the cats where he belongs. In our own bed. In our own place. 

They send him home on the 5th of jan, saying he had days left. Stopt eating and drinking in the hospital. Then he got home and started eating and drinking with our bed picknicks, sitting up and saying he was going to get better . Saying that i shouldn’t cry and that he was not going to die. His birthday was on the 15th and we celebrated, the last thing he ate was a giant bowl of crumble and custerd. His favorite. 

On the 16th he’s slowly started sleeping deeper and deeper. Yesterday they put a driver in. I don’t want to leave his side. He’s not waking up anymore. Theres nurses in and out of the bedroom and phonecalls and messages and we got his brother and our best friend here. 

Im in bed next to him, he’s had the hiccups non-stop but the meds arn’t doing to much. 
Thankfuck they put a tiny canula in his arm and i am aloud to give him topups of pain meds .
His chest is really rattly, he hiccups and it rattles, the nurses assured me he doesn’t notice it himself, but sometimes he moans and groans. 
If i pretend thats not happening it just feels like normal in bed. My legs against his. I don’t ever want to loose this exact feeling. The feeling how his body feels against mine, how we breathe in sync. He is my soulmate, the love of my life, my everything, and now its really over. I don’t know what to do when he is gone.",2021-01-21 15:10:30+00:00,12,"                                                 body

I went to the ER for me but ended up staying and sitting with my chemo buddy till he passed...,404,a9wgqi,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/a9wgqi/i_went_to_the_er_for_me_but_ended_up_staying_and/,29,"I was in a lot of pain and ended up going to the ER. While I was there, I saw “Charleston Chew”. He was my chemo buddy, as we were close in age and had pretty similar schedules. 
In his very crude and sarcastic way, he softly yelled “Hello my delicious Korean BBQ”, his nickname for me. I smiled, as he tried to chuck an ice chip at me. I could tell something was wrong because he looked and sounded weaker than usual. I asked the nurse why he was there and she couldn’t disclose anything but said in short, things weren’t looking good. After I got looked at and discharged, I went over to him.
I asked him what was up and he told me that he went to spend Christmas with his family and he wasn’t feeling well but wanted to give them that. He flew back and straight to the ER. He looked at me and asked if I’d stay with him but to go if I had plans cause “a girl who looks as hot as you with cancer, should have plans and be getting laid”. Our humor is (was) similar. I stayed and I told him about my holidays and he struggled to tell me about his... I think I knew what was happening because it took everything in me to not start breaking down and cry in front of him.

He told me about the first time we met. I had already been a regular and he was a fish out of water. He had Stage 4 lung cancer and was given 6-12 months to live. He didn’t understand why he was doing chemo, as he felt his quality of life was going to be shittier. But he saw a “delicious Korean BBQ” girl with a sassy attitude who he could make friends with and it made going back, a little easier every day. I didn’t know that... 
We are (were) both in our 30’s and talked about our life being on hold, while everyone else was busy getting married, popping babies, buying houses — as we impeded doom, death, and debt. Haha. 
The reason I called him Charleston Chew at the beginning was because he had an affinity for that damn candy. When he couldn’t eat anything else, you could count on him sucking on those damn things at any hour. I’m pretty sure that was his only nutrition for the past 8 months. One time he smiled and it was just melted chocolate and nougat, I nearly peed myself from laughter. 
When things got hard, we leaned on each other. When we got fed up with this whole process, we understood it. We could confide in one another. When we got stupid depressed and suicidal, we could go to one another without judgement. We also binge watched all of The Wire, Gilmore Girls, and Marvelous Mrs Maisel together. (Gilmore Girls was his pick) We became real friends. 
His support system was flying in from out of town and there would be times when he was alone, so I’d FaceTime him. He would try and convince me he had friends but I knew he had a hard time asking for help—- as I knew that feeling all too well. He’d joke that if he wasn’t dying, that some would consider what we were doing as “dating”. Haha. 

The doctors were able to find him a bed upstairs to make him more comfortable. He asked me if it was selfish to not give his family the “last moments” as he could have stayed home with them and I honestly didn’t know what to say. They were called and on their way. And everyone knew there was a good chance he’d be gone by the time they arrived. He told me he didn’t want to be by himself and for the first time, I think I really saw him. He asked me to stay and to not let him die alone. He said he was scared and that’s when I lost it. I apologized for crying and he said his dying wish was for a blowjob. Hahaha. He really knew how to use humor till the end. But even through his crude humor, I knew he was being honest in asking me to stay. 
So I did. I held his hand and told him about all the plans I had for 2019, after I get the all-okay from my doctors. All the traveling I want to do, the places I want to see, the food I want to eat, and air I want to feel. And he said “You deserve it. Where ever you go, take me with you.” 
At some point he kind of stopped responding. The machines didn’t make a huge fuss but the nurses came over and I knew. Luckily the staff didn’t kick me out because I wasn’t family, they allowed me to sit with him till his family got there. I didn’t know I’d be so emotional... this person, someone that was a stranger less than a year ago, had become a dear friend because we connected over this sick disease and I just watched him die. His death wasn’t about me but I couldn’t help but think “cancer you bitch, you could take me too....” and I was both heartbroken and grateful for his death and my life. 

As his family arrived, I gave them their space. His mom knew who I was and just gave me a big hug. She said “All he did was talk about how his new friend, he made his last few months, were some of the greatest months. And more importantly, thank you not letting him go alone. For staying by his side. Thank you for giving that gift to my son.” I had no idea I had any impact on one’s life like that... his whole family kept thanking me for staying with him till the end. 

I literally went to the ER because I was in pain but call it fate, destiny, kismet, the stars aligning or whatever... but I was meant to be there for more and something bigger than myself. To show up for my friend Charleston Chew. 

May you RIP dear friend. Maybe in another timeline I’m giving you that blowjob you dearly wanted. Haha. 
Thanks for everything. Rest easy.",2018-12-27 05:49:11+00:00,15,"                                                 body

"Just put my wife in hospice, she's 29.",391,jizpbl,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jizpbl/just_put_my_wife_in_hospice_shes_29/,46,"I have no idea what to say here. 

I'm sitting by my wife right now and she is in and out of consciousness, with her awake times being full of confusion. She has stage 4 Cervical cancer, which started in her cervix last year, but was too large when we caught it to do surgery. After a successful radiation therapy treatment she was declared cured in November 2019.

May 2020 we found it had metastasized to her liver, and after 4 months of chemo that didn't work, and one round of immunotherapy that failed, we are now here. There are no eligible clinical trials, no other treatments. Her life, hopes and dreams, everything we said we'd do but never did, it's all over.

I can't say goodbye. Two weeks ago we were going for a night drive and complaining about the world, politics, breakfast burritos with fish. She was in pain but full of smiles and life. Now she isn't able to comprehend fully what is happening. She can't tell me it's OK. She can respond sometimes but she doesn't really connect to anything happening. I know this is probably for the best for her, but it rips me apart that I don't have a chance to discuss anything that's happening to us. I'll never have another conversation with my best friend and I can't handle it. 

I want a miracle. I wish it was me instead of her. She's a better person than I am.",2020-10-27 11:55:08+00:00,16,"                                                 body

"A small personal guide on how I deal with terminal cancer, if it can help anyone at all even a bit",378,aaabgx,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/aaabgx/a_small_personal_guide_on_how_i_deal_with/,53,"I'm 30 and going to die soon. I've had a year to come to terms with it. Here is how I rationalize it if it can be of help to anyone.

I was lucky to have so much time to think this over, time really does help to accept the inevitable. We all know it's coming someday. It just comes sooner for some. People say I'm pretty zen considering the circumstances and I'd say it is an accurate assessment. I certainly wouldn't be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time. I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it.

I'm not saying it's a walk in the park either, I have serious pain issues, I'm heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad. No, it's not your fault you have cancer, but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll. I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug. Which brings me to making a small list of what helps me deal with the situation. This is the internet after all and we like lists!

* **I surround myself with people who make me feel good.** Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and that's ok, we all have our strength and weaknesses. Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to. Let them deal with their emotions, they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you.

* **I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise.** I'm a young adult, statistically, I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash, not of cancer. I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral, to write letters to loved ones, to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well. I think this is much preferable to the alternative, but I've met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe I'm the exception.

* **I've already been dead for a few billion years, and it wasn't too bad.** As you can guess from this I don't believe in an afterlife at all. For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth. The year 1900 isn't very scary to me even if I did not exist. The year 2020 isn't very scary to me for the same reasons. Non-existence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universe's lifespan. Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort.

* **I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness.** I know some people have a need for the illusion of control, but the truth is that apart from eating well, sleeping sufficiently, doing you chemo/treatment, getting a bit of exercise even if it's just walking and making the effort to have a social life, all of these when possible, then you're already doing everything you can. Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not, so try to enjoy the ride even if you're not the one driving.

* **I have little time, it is precious, but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty.** I can't let the feeling that I'm somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over. I have little time, yes, but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty. My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality.

* **I give myself small goals and projects.** If I just wait passively for death, then I feel like it's wasted time. Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most, then I'll find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of. In my case, it's writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral. For me, productive time is a happy time, especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones.

* **I've lived making sure I'd regret nothing and I'm surrounded by loved ones.** Now, this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part. I'm lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when I'd be dying I wouldn't regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish. I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life. Maybe it's too late for you to apply that advice, but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing in my life apart from cancer. I also understand you don't control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships, and I'm sorry if that's the case. There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute. Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this.


There, I think that covers it. I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it. Good luck everyone!",2018-12-28 13:30:11+00:00,19,"                                                 body

"My son, Andreas, has terminal brain cancer and needs the world to know",374,nzzm9r,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/nzzm9r/my_son_andreas_has_terminal_brain_cancer_and/,34,"Hi community. I have an 11 year old son, Andreas, that has AT/RT brain cancer. He was diagnosed in late May 2018. Since then he has received around 200 chemotherapy doses (initially the primary AT/RT protocol treatment, then the medulloblastoma ""MEMMAT"" protocol treatment), over 70 radiation therapies to his brain and spine, undergone several surgeries to remove tumors, and countless MRI scans. The initial surgery in 2018 which removed the primary tumor, made his left hand and leg semi-paralyzed (spastic) and his right eye non-functional (the pupil is always dilated and the movement is not coordinated with the other eye).

&#x200B;

During the last three years we've received the ""he's not gonna make it past the next months""-message several times. And Andreas fought back. Each time. Metastasis in the spine? Radiation therapy. Metastasis in the brain? MEMMAT protocol with chemotherapy doses administered on average 2.5 times per week for over a year. More tumors in the brain? More radiation therapy, last time was in April 2021. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, even though he's been through hell and back, the cancer still grows. At least 10 tumors spread around the brain is now growing. He's starting to lose his ability to speak and swallow, due to a large tumor growing in the cerebellum. We have started with a fairly experimental drug called Tazverik, but the odds are so heavily against him and he is tired. He is currently trying to make peace with the fact that he is going to die very soon and he is saying his last goodbyes to friends and family.

&#x200B;

In April 2019, when we received one of the ""you're not gonna make it""-messages from the doctors, a childhood friend of mine (Lasse) who's a great musician, wrote a song to Andreas called ""Main man"" and recorded this with his band ""Few Dollars More"". This song has meant the world to Andreas. We listen to it several times a day and it gives us a mix of serenity, peace, melancholy and sorrow. Andreas finds great comfort in knowing that he actually has a song that the world will remember him by. He has requested me to ""write to Reddit"" and ask if they can listen to the song, because it is so important to him to let the world know that this song exists. All profits made from playbacks on Spotify/Tidal/Youtube goes to the The Norwegian Childhood Cancer Organization, so there are no individual profiting from this. Andreas just wants the song to be played for him these last weeks.

&#x200B;

I am asking ""Reddit"" to visit Youtube and listen to his song. I am posting this in several subreddits and I am sorry if I'm breaking the rules of the subreddit you read this in by asking for views and likes, but right now I've got nothing to lose.

&#x200B;

Links in comments

EDIT - thank you so much for all the wonderful comments and awards and whatnot. I’ve read all the beautiful comments and PM’s I’ve received to him, and he wanted to say thank you to the Reddit community:

https://youtu.be/8I26lwQQRzQ

It’s in Norwegian but he’s saying: “Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I really appreciated.. thanks for all the nice things you wrote to me. That made me happy”

&#x200B;

EDIT 2 - Andreas loves to hear all your thoughts and comments. He really appreciates them. Thank you all of you. This has been a very good day for him, and each and every one of you have contributed to that. I asked him if he wanted to say something more. He wanted to do that (English translation in the description field on the YT video):

I'm not a mod or anything, but I thought someone should say this. So far I have already seen several posts from people who came here after hearing the news of Chadwick Boseman's tragic and early death. I am just as shocked and upset as everyone else is, given how young he was and the fact that no one knew he was sick. An untimely death from cancer is a very real and present fear for many of us who post here. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones.

I do want to remind the readers and newcomers here that this sub is a support sub for cancer patients, caregivers, and family. We are not able to diagnose anyone. We are all going through, or have been through, significant hardship. Please remember the rules of this forum, and please refrain from posting just regarding news of his death, questions about colon cancer, and asking if you could have cancer, having learned of his death.

Here are a couple of resources you can look at if you are concerned about colon cancer, any cancer, or want to know more. These resources are way more extensive and accurate than what the posters here can offer. Thanks for reading.

What cancer feels like,311,kwq1ba,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/kwq1ba/what_cancer_feels_like/,51,"This isn't my writing but I post it every few months as everyone with cancer should read it:


What’s it like to go through cancer treatment?

It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric sabre fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whomever) is rolling around on the ground clutching their nose, and they've bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.
 

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
 

Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “f**k this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”",2021-01-13 21:11:46+00:00,27,"                                                 body

My wife is ready to die.

Her doctors have done all they can. They were committed to recovering her well-being and the quality of life she deserves but the disease was stronger than them. 

This morning she finally told me she's ready to stop, and I informed her doctors. Her family and friends have started to visit her and will continue to visit her during the next few days.

I don't know how long it will take, but the doctors and nurses have promised us it will be as peaceful and comfortable as possible for her. I really hope they can fulfill that promise. 

She is at peace. I am at peace.

I will be forever grateful to you all for the support we have received since her diagnosis. I couldn't have done my job as caretaker as well as I did without this community.

My wife passed away. I want to thank you all (once again).,274,cv90i8,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/cv90i8/my_wife_passed_away_i_want_to_thank_you_all_once/,29,"I don't know why I have been avoiding writing this post. I used to read the sub everyday and write frequently. Now I just can't seem to have any words left in me.

My wife (/u/eternalthesiswriter) passed away on August 15th. She didn't use reddit much, but when she was diagnosed I told her about this place and she came here for advice. Everyone was very kind and gave us great tips that helped us through the beginning of her journey with cancer. Later on, I became an active member of the sub. Being here and sharing the experience with all of you helped me, helped us, so much. You showed me the power of community. I asked for help; I vented and freely expressed my frustrations and fears; I shared the good, the bad, and the ugly. I was never judged, my pain was never undermined, I received the support I was looking for and so desperately needed. I am so thankful to all of you.

My wife's last months were very difficult. She was in and out of the hospital since February until she died, she developed chronic pain and then opioid dependency, she was very depressed and exhausted. I watched her slip away day by day and I don't think I'll ever completely heal from that. We suffered so much through it. However, her last few days were beautiful. She had the chance to decide to stop all treatments that were not intended to give her comfort. She was able to decide when and where to die. I don't how I did it, but I hosted a horde of people at the hospital, sat with them in the waiting room and explained what was happening, gave them gentle instructions so she would still be comfortable around people while being so vulnerable, comforted them outside her room after they said goodbye to her, kept the spirits up by reminding everyone she lived a full life, was truly and fully loved, and was dying surrounded by me, her friends, and her family. I did it for her. I did it because I knew she needed to see all the people she had loved throughout her life. But it was hard and we didn't have much time together. I don't regret it, but still it hurts. She was at peace and happy at the end. She left with a smile on her face and that was a great gift. I knew then and there I had done a good job despite the circumstances. 

Yes, she died, but we had such a great time together and she was so loved. Not only when she was healthy, but also when she was living with cancer and then dying of cancer. I gave up my whole life to be her partner, her caretaker, and her unconditional 24/7 support through the disease, and I'm so, so, so glad I did it. I quit my job, I spent my savings, I lost many of my friends. There has been nothing else and there will be nothing else more important than those nineteenth months we spent together. I appreciate and cherish every second of the journey, even the horrible, traumatizing, painful parts of it because I had the honor to be with her and love through it.

She's gone and I'm slowly trying to rebuild my life. Doing this without her hurts all the time. I miss her so much. I have a lot of support: my friends and her friends have showered me with compassion, patience, understanding, practical help, and possibly too much food. Yet, I don't know how I'll make it without her, but I'm trying. I promised her I would be ok, so I'm trying. I hope she knows I'm trying. I hope wherever she is she has forgiven me for my mistakes and shortcomings. I hope wherever she is she knows I love her, I will always love her, I have always loved her. 

Thank you everybody for being there for us. I will be forever grateful to all of you. I admire you and respect you all so much. We are stronger than anyone else can imagine. Thank you for making the decision to live and love everyday in face of this disease. In the end, whatever happens, whether you or your loved one gets cured or dies, that's what really matters: the love you give yourself and the love you give others.",2019-08-25 14:16:16+00:00,40,"                                                 body

What’s a surprise though? is that i feel great? i don’t feel in in pain anymore. I wanna eat everything! I feel… so much better. I expected a slow undignified death, and now i can go to sleep eating a lot of food and letting there’s nurses show they shouldn’t check my blood sugars. 
 I don’t know when to die now. I’m content for the nurses to take over all my gross jobs and just spend my last orders getting ace food but accepting my death has ironically just made me feel a lot better. Thinking about pudding right now! Gonna hve a tasty cup of tea, two sugars, the warm drink will be welcome on my throat!


I feels like mad to waste time with family when I feel so renewed. I was in such a poor health, physically at weak, and now I accepted death and i feel like i can hang in my hospital room. 

I wasn’t expecting to be feel so recovered from throwing in the towel. Not sure what to do now. Do I stay or do I Go?",2021-10-29 06:13:56+00:00,42,"                                                 body

Unknown author perfect analogy of what’s its like to have cancer and go through treatment,267,afhxsj,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/afhxsj/unknown_author_perfect_analogy_of_whats_its_like/,67,"I don’t know who wrote this. I saw it someplace else and just had to share. I’ve never seen it here so hopefully not a repost.  Great read. 



What it's like to go thru cancer and treatment 
 

What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? 
It’s something like this: One day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.
Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whoever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it *also* punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying, “Can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead. 
Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say, “That was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!” 

Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “Boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “Fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.😳”

I walked in on my dad crying in the kitchen yesterday,261,lwddzo,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/lwddzo/i_walked_in_on_my_dad_crying_in_the_kitchen/,66,"I'm 21 years old, and living at home right now with my family because my university closed due to COVID-19. My dad has stage 4 liver and colon cancer.

Yesterday I walked into the kitchen to make myself lunch and saw my dad hunched over the sink sobbing quietly.

He got his most recent MRI scan results back, and he has more tumors in his liver now. He can't do chemo anymore because it almost killed him last round, and his white blood cell count is too low. He already did two major surgeries, so he's at the limit of how much more than can offer for treatment.

I try not to cry in front of my dad. I remind him that he's still here and that he's made it this far. I hug him and tell him that I love him. But when I'm in my room on Zoom during my lectures, I just keep my camera off, my mic muted, and cry silently with my door closed.

He's been packing up all his things in his office. He's making calls to tie up loose ends and get his affairs in order, so we don't have to when he dies.

He keeps apologizing to me, telling me that he's sorry I won't have a dad anymore. He says he wishes he had more time with us. When I look at him, I see how scared he is to die.

I hate cancer so much. My dad doesn't deserve this. I've seen him slowly deteriorate so much in this past year physically, but the worst thing yet has been seeing how now his spirit is deteriorating.

Sometimes I feel like I'm a little kid again. I just want my dad. I hate seeing him pack up all his stuff. He's preparing to leave and not come back.

I don't want it to get worse, but it probably will. I don't know exactly how much time I have left with my dad, but my heart is breaking each day knowing I will probably lose him before the end of the year.

F\*ck cancer! I hate it so much.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments. I'm so grateful for your support and for the perspectives you've offered me. I'm not responding right now because I keep tearing up when I read the comments and I want to take a breather on the crying today, but I'll try and come back to respond later.

My little girl made it through brain surgery yesterday!,253,avvrax,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/avvrax/my_little_girl_made_it_through_brain_surgery/,15,"And it was a success, thankfully. 
Initially her surgeons were only planning to sample enough abnormal tissue to get a diagnosis. When they got in there, i guess the tumour was more easily distinguishable than they thought, so they were able to remove everything that looked abnormal in her brain. Her post-op MRI didn’t show any remaining tumour either which is fantastic. We aren’t out of the woods by any means but this is the best possible outcome we could have had so far. 

Our next big hurdle is the pathology results. If it comes back as a high grade tumour like ATRT (which is likely) we will need to begin chemo as soon as possible to kill any remaining cells. 

Aside from all that she is doing amazing. she woke up within an hour from surgery and was talking to us, and she may be able to leave PICU and go to the regular ward today! It’s only been 24 hours so I’m surprised. She hasn’t complained not once, and she’s only on a very small dose of morphine. 

She blows me away with her strength and resilience. I never expected that my 4 year old would be able to breeze through brain surgery like it was no biggie. She is such a little fighter.

I'm 18. I lost my mom. I'll be okay.,255,a7tw1k,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/a7tw1k/im_18_i_lost_my_mom_ill_be_okay/,27,"She was coming home from a chemo treatment and was fine. She got onto the couch, felt short of breath, and asked my dad to rub her back to calm her down.

She then closed her eyes, leaned against him to rest, and passed. She died in the comfort of her own home, not hooked up to machines in hospice. She was beside the man who was the love of her life, her caretaker, and just went to sleep. She didn't suffer.

She doesn't have to suffer.

She lost mobility in her legs so she couldn't even use the bathroom alone. She absolutely hated it, having to wear adult diapers and not having any independence.

My mom is finally free from this disgusting, awful disease. I miss her so fucking much, of course. She was my best friend, after all.

But.. she's finally free from the medication and the needles and the captivity that NSCLC held her in.

She has her beautiful, long, brown hair back. She can sing with a full voice, her throat not aching. She can walk again.

I loved her until the end, and I still love her. My last words were, ""Love you, see you later.""

She lived the day like it was any other, and didn't have to count down to her own death.

You're free, mama. I'm going to think of her when I walk across that stage during graduation, and I know she'll be watching me.

The best news of my life: Mom’s stage IV lung cancer has gone into complete remission.,252,f6ira6,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/f6ira6/the_best_news_of_my_life_moms_stage_iv_lung/,76,"Hey guys, 

I promised to keep you updated, so I really want to share that moment with you. About 5 weeks ago my mom had her first control PET scan after four cycles of chemotherapy and Keytruda, two Keytruda-only infusions, a metastectomy of the spine and IMRT of the spine. Her PET scan showed that all her metastatic sites had disappeared, all her lymph nodes had cleared up and her tumor had shrunk from 88x64 to 19x11mm. 

Her doctors decided to ablate the original tumor with SBRT so we returned to the hospital this Monday. The radiation oncologist did a CT scan and then some respiratory simulation. 

Today...my phone starts ringing in the morning, I see an unknown number. I pick up: “Hello, this is Dr.X, your mother’s radiation oncologist.” 

At this point my heart skips probably half a minute worth of regular beats. Her doctors have never called us before, so I fear bad news (more extensive disease than anticipated so no SBRT).

Next, Dr.X continues: “I cannot do SBRT because your mom’s cancer has disappeared entirely. My colleagues and I have been looking at the PET-CT scan and yesterday’s CT images and we literally cannot see a single dot of what was there 5 weeks ago. Congratulations, your mom has responded completely to Keytruda monotherapy and her cancer has fled her lung faster than we could manage to ablate it.” I probably say: “Are you sure?”, “Thank you”, “Amazing” and “How’s that possible” more times than I can count.

I am not even sure what’s going on right now. It seems absolutely surreal that in 4-5 short months my mom has gone from 6 painkillers a day, facing one of the deadliest cancers, to...my old mom, pain-free, happy, full of life, eager to return to work, take care of our home and her favorite dog, and travel.

Her doctors seem equally...pleasantly surprised. As I have mentioned before, mom’s PDL1 negative, so the odds of her responding to Keytruda were quite slim to begin with. A complete response...I was afraid to even dream of that.

She will stay on Keytruda for another 18 months. 

Thank you guys so much for the incredible support all throughout that uphill battle. I will stick around r/cancer for as long as I can help anyone out. ❤️",2020-02-19 22:36:57+00:00,51,"                                                 body

Wife passed away yesterday morning…,246,osrpdi,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/osrpdi/wife_passed_away_yesterday_morning/,53,"We were married 25 years.  We had a fairly normal marriage, we were broke and did not have any real money for years, we had our ups and downs, argued, got aggravated with each other, all the normal stuff a healthy marriage has, but we loved each other very much and we had big plans, we worked hard, saved our money, got out of debt and were saving for the day that we could buy a travel trailer and retire, what a dream!

She was diagnosed with cancer about two years ago.  The earliest indication that she had cancer started with an emergency room visit for stomach pains and yellowing eyes. When the diagnosis was revealed to her, it was described as stage 2b pancreatic cancer for which was explained as a best case scenario.  She was so strong at that point an absolute trooper!  She entered chemotherapy resulting in quick hair loss which was of course devastating for her.  She went for a total of 16 weeks of chemo, 4 weeks of radiation everyday, and the Whipple surgery that was extremely difficult to say the least.  After all of this my wife was a shell of herself, depressed, sick, literally skin and bones but after she healed up from the surgery, indications were that the cancer was gone, so she entered what they described as remission.  

That was about exactly 1 year ago.  We had a few months at that point of a somewhat back to normal life, she started eating better, she started exercising a little, she even went back to work for a few weeks.  She was seeing the doctor every couple weeks for her checkups and about 9 months ago her blood test revealed a slight increase in her cancer marker.  The next few tests showed an exponential increase each time for the cancer marker. The diagnosis at this point was the cancer is back with vengeance and she was given 6 months to a year of life left.

We got to have 1 month of somewhat quality time before she started getting extremely sick again with severe stomach pain radiating around to her back. It was at this time that home hospice was recommended. Hospice helped a lot but they would only visit when needed and once per week to refill meds and take vitals. After about a month I started to notice that my wife was having some cognitive problems and was beginning to have trouble walking.  A week or so later she began to have more cognitive problems and also began sleeping a lot more and was unable to walk.  It was no time at all that her right leg developed a blood clot which threatened to take her life. Within just a few days before we even realized what was happening her leg began turning black. At this time she was transferred to a hospital to be evaluated.  She was on the verge of death for a few days and was going to be sent to a hospice home to die. After two complete days of bed rest she woke up and made a mini recovery, enough to tell me that she wanted to die at home and just wanted to go home.  A decision was made to remove her leg above the knee so that she could return home with me.  The amputation went well and after a few days we returned home.  That was 5 weeks ago.  

Confined to a wheelchair we began to work on her recovery from the surgery.  I rearranged the house and my life to accommodate, I stayed home from work to care for her. At first I thought she might make a good recovery because she started eating well and seemed happy. She was home and had her bed to sleep in but the depression began and with my best efforts I was unable to help her with the depression.  I should have saw the signs but i didn’t, she began to eat less and drink less at first.

Her final day alive was like so many others, breakfast, tea, stomach pain and sickness.  She started the day wheezy and needing a breathing treatment, her voice was a little strained but she did not seem worried and was using oxygen whenever she felt that she needed it. She got worse as the day went on, I started calling the nurse to get help.  It was about 630am when she asked me for a breathing treatment and some tea, she was wheezy and having considerable trouble talking.  I setup the breathing treatment and then went to make her the tea. I returned with the tea and unhooked her breathing treatment pump.  She saw the tea and gave me a thumbs up.  I went to the bathroom and when I returned to her a few minutes later she was not breathing and had passed away on me and despite my best efforts to revive her she was gone.

I just wanted to share my story to all who might listen.  I hope it helps others to understand how truly destructive cancer can be.  My wife was only 56 years old and all our dreams and aspirations were stolen from us.  Cancer took the strongest person I have ever known from me and destroyed my life.  On top of it all cancer took our entire life savings and put me in debt for the next 20 years.  I truly hate cancer and will never ever forgive what it did to us.

This kind of response from total strangers gives me hope that if we all work together we can make a difference in the fight to end cancer.",2021-07-27 17:52:07+00:00,55,"                                                 body

Dr. Has given me the choice to continue to fight or get comfortable and begin to make arrangements for the end. I’m 35 and dying was never an option until yesterday.,241,czwkrb,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/czwkrb/dr_has_given_me_the_choice_to_continue_to_fight/,84,"The team of doctors I have did what I feared the most since this all started. They walked in the room and basically said nothing we’ve done up to this point has worked and there is a strong possibility it will never work. Chemo along with the other options of treatment may very well make the end for me come quicker then anticipated or actually kill me itself. The choice now I have in front of me is to stop and get ready for the end or fight on with the strong chance that it’ll all be for nothing. The cancer could withstand all the treatment we throw at it and then I die anyway just now have wasted precious time that could’ve been spent with my family and friends trying to make the best of these last few weeks or months. It’s been under a year since I was diagnosed. I thought this would be something that came and went. I’d fight it and I’d win because that’s the way it’s supposed to go. I never ever thought it’d become fatal. I asked my doc why, and bad luck is the only answer I get. I’m thirty five years old married without any kids.

I’m been told my cancer isn’t curable and I’m lost,233,fqtfrf,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fqtfrf/im_been_told_my_cancer_isnt_curable_and_im_lost/,52,"So... this week I was told that my cancer isn’t curable. I was diagnosed in September 2019 with liver metastasis while roughly 7 months pregnant. I was told it don’t look good, but there was hope.

After a lot of meetings they decided to do a C-section, so my beautiful little girl arrived about 7 weeks too early. Healthy and strong. I was put on chemo until December when they decided it had shrunk enough and in January I underwent a massive surgery, removing about 70% of my liver. 

Sadly that didn’t seem to be enough. Markers in my blood were back this month, and after a PET scan they now know that it’s spread to my bones... spine and hips at least, and I don’t have a lot of time left. My oncologist estimated 1-2 years. I got the news this week. And I feel so horribly lost. I look at my little girl, now almost 6 months old and I... hurt, I ache, I want to be there for her... I want to see her grow up and turn into the beautiful strong woman I know she’ll be. I feel so cheated, I was starting the best part of my life and now I’ve been told that it’s ending...

Now I’m in no way giving up, I’m back on chemo and I’m going to fight this with everything I have, I’m going to look for every clinical trial and experimental treatment, but sometimes I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I’m 31 and all I want with every fibre of my being is to be there for my girl and partner.

So if anyone has any tips, advice, treatments to recommend... anything. I just want to feel a little less lost.

Edit: So lost I can’t even type anymore it seems, that’s what you get for crying and typing. Thanks for all the love and motivation so far though. ❤️",2020-03-28 21:52:34+00:00,64,"                                                 body

Being Single with Cancer,229,ibhhkd,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ibhhkd/being_single_with_cancer/,80,"I want to give a shoutout to everyone who's going through cancer while single. I see so many posts from caretakers asking how they can better support their partners, or grateful posts from people thanking their spouses, kids, partners, SOs, etc. 

I see posts talking about how hard Covid has been because their partners can't come with them to appointments or treatments, can't be with them in surgery. But that's been the reality for single people long before Covid. We were already doing that. It's hard but it's possible.

I went through cancer while single (I'm still navigating it months after active treatment). Its been hard. I relied on my parents (who live in another city) and friends (but it's not the same when you're living alone). Recovering from surgery in an empty apartment, not having someone to hug you when the side effects are too much, no one to calm you down the first day you wake up with hair all over your pillow, no one to help take care of surgical wounds, no one to rub your back when your throwing up at 2am. 

It's. So. Hard. 

But you know what? I see fewer complaints from the people doing it on their own than I do from people with partners. You know that you have to do this because you don't have someone to pick up the slack. 

I'm a few months out of treatment now. I went through 4 surgeries and chemotherapy on my own. I went to appointments alone, took notes so I wouldn't forget things, tracked my meds, recovered alone. I know so many of you out there are doing the same, and doing it with very few complaints, because you are your own support system.

If anyone is currently going through treatment on their own and they need someone to talk to, don't be afraid to reach out. You've got this. **You're so strong.**",2020-08-17 16:33:55+00:00,65,"                                                 body

Rant: I'm sorry but I don't care about your granny,228,79uf6q,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/79uf6q/rant_im_sorry_but_i_dont_care_about_your_granny/,101,"I'm so fucking sick of people trying to relate with me by telling me about their 80 something year old grandpa or great uncle who died of cancer. Your goddamn grandpa had kids. And then grandkids. And a full career and probably a happy marriage or two. 

I'm 26 with colon cancer. I poop into a bag that hangs off my abdomen and the career I busted my for over the last 3 years effectively ended with my diagnosis. The fucks I give about your granny go about as far as the colon that's left in my body and that's not lot these days. 

Then theres the other end of the spectrum. ""Oh yeah, my cousins best friend died of breast cancer when she was 32. It was so sad."" FUCKING THANKS. THATS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT RIGHT NOW. 

Stop pretending you know what this is for me with your sap stories. How about instead you tell me about your buddy who lost his leg to cancer and is back running half marathons again. Actually fuck that, don't just tell me about him, give me his number so we can run a race together when I can run again. 

I realize that it's incredibly hard to find the right thing to say when you're on the outside but people need to realize that sometimes saying nothing is better than opening your mouth just for the sake of speaking. Give me a hug. Tell me you love me and that you're sorry I'm going through this. 

I'm sure your granny was an absolutely wonderful woman but frankly, I don't give a damn right now. ",2017-10-31 08:30:10+00:00,67,"                                                 body

My story,222,hspsds,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hspsds/my_story/,40,"Tl;dr: Basically I beat Stage 4 brain cancer.
If y’all would like more details or some pics let me know

So back in August 2015 I was diagnosed with the equivalent of stage 4 (the type of cancer I had wasn’t measured in stages) brain cancer. I had two tumors, which were malignant, one on my pituitary and the other on my hypothalamus. I got treated at the University of Virginia, had biopsy brain surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. And am close to 5 years in remission 

In Order the pictures should be: 
1st:me standing and smiling; about 3 1/2 months before the cancer was found

2nd: Me in a hospital bed; the day before the cancer was found, when I was 85.7 lbs

3rd: Me with my Dad; minutes after the 2nd pic

Best Easter news of all... STILL CANCER FREE AFTER STAGE IV DIAGNOSIS!!!,221,g0c7uu,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/g0c7uu/best_easter_news_of_all_still_cancer_free_after/,19,"Hi everyone!

I've posted on here quite a few times about my dad. You can look through my posts if you want more background. But king story short, my 50 year old dad was diagnosed stage IV colorectal cancer in May 2019. He had extensive chemo, then liver surgery in November, then more chemo (last one on christmas eve!)

Now, we are 5 months COMPLETELY cancer free and we are hoping for him to be cured forever. Stage IV is unbelievably heartbreaking. But we are some of the lucky few that have gotten through this. I hope this can be encouraging for others on this same journey.

Thank you to everyone for your continued support for my family! I love this community",2020-04-13 04:52:38+00:00,70,"                                                 body

Thankfully all the lymph nodes they removed were clear and my scan showed no sign of cancer so I had another 6 chemo sessions just to make sure everything was completely nuked and I'm now officially 12 months cancer free!!

Just a few weeks ago we went to the oncologist for a check-up and the doctor was being very frank. He said the fact that she hadn't had a bowel movement in a month was big cause for concern, and that if imaging showed an obstruction there would be nothing we could really do except increase the pain medication. She looked at him for a minute and said, ""well, that's a truly *shitty* way to die,"" and then laughed.

From stage 4 NSC Lung Cancer to No Evidence of Disease,218,i1wtfr,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/i1wtfr/from_stage_4_nsc_lung_cancer_to_no_evidence_of/,48,"Things didn't look good for me 8 months ago. I'm a 24 y.o. non-smoker who found out I had NCSLC with metastises to my bones, lymph nodes, and, extensively, to my brain. I didn't think I could ever be NED. My oncologist admits that she didn't think it was likely either, but she resolved to be as aggressive as possible.

I was put on targeted pills for my specific mutation (ALK) and also had whole brain radiation, lung surgery, gamma knife surgery, and chest radiation. Now I have NED and will be on the pills until they stop working. 

At the start of this, I was so desperate to find success stories. I know that I have been unbelievably lucky so far, and I also know that this is not over and I will not have the long life I used to think I would have. The decades to fill. But I have right now, and I hope my story can give someone at least a little hope. It was only three years ago that the medication that has so far worked so well for me was approved for first-line treatment. Things are moving. I only wish I had the money or the brains to help them move faster.

I see people who at the absolute *worst times in their lives* are still reaching out and trying to find ways to help others. Both loved ones and total strangers. The daily kindness I see just blows me away. So, to answer my friends question, no, it doesn't depress me, it inspires me.

Patients, survivors, spouses, children, caretakers, youre all here because of the same Crappy reason. But, what you do here is what makes it amazing. I wish us **all** a better 2019, but thank you all for everything you've done in 2018. Keep fighting the good fight everyone!

After 7 years of living with the specter of death hanging over my shoulder every day I'm  fucking overjoyed and a bit overwhelmed. I have an Olidendrioglioma brain tumor and people dont really live after getting this diagnosis. Originally the life expectancy was 2 years I'm at 7 years and my doctor just said 20 to 25+ more. I just got a second adult life with no expectation of seeing the next winter. Now I can enjoy a long marriage to my girlfriend, owning a home again, seeing my 14yo nephew graduate from High School. Just getting this down now is a little overwhelming. When I told the kid he gave the most beautiful ""yeahhhhh"" ever.
It has been 1 round radiation, 2 chemo and 4 brain surgeries but I got to the finish line.
 I've been telling everyone about it even my Lyft driver and it makes them happy. 
If your in the middle of chemo or radiation or the fight is just grinding you into the ground don't ever give up. The bad days are just that days, you might get an entire life back. ",2018-12-22 22:51:20+00:00,83,"                                                 body

He only got back from the hospital on Tuesday evening. He was on oxygen and a hospital bed in our living room.

He asked for the nebulizer because he couldn't breathe, the nebulizer didn't work.  He just could not get any air into his lungs. 

He asked if was dying,  he said he loved me.  After a couple of minutes of struggling for air he lost consciousness and passed away. He was 47 years old.

Bye (?),210,8diciq,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8diciq/bye/,39,"I met with my oncologist today. Things are not looking good. I was pulled off an oral chemo two months ago due to blood clots. Now the oncologist is hesitant to put me on another chemo because my blood counts are low and my body weight continues to be low. I have tried over several months to put on weight but it is just not working. High protein and calorie drinks, icecreams, pbj sandwiches, mashed potatoes - name it, I have tried them.

Add to that, my daily terrible stomach pains, nausea, bloating and all other issues makes it extremely difficult for me to eat or drink like a normal person. I guess its just the nature of the disease or cachexia.

So after having gone through the standard cancer treatments - chemo, radiation, surgery, chemo...my options are at a dead end. The oncologist said that without treatment I could last perhaps a few weeks, months to a year - he cannot really say. And even if I were to get chemo, it won't help me much, maybe add a little more time to the inevitable.

So, I guess thats it. I lost my wife to another non-related cancer a few years ago. She was 38. And now I am facing death before reaching 50. My son who is majoring in Biology because he wants to be a doctor (A determined decision made by him after his mom's death) will unfortunately become an orphan.

I shall continue to help others as much as possible in this wonderful supportive sub, as I have been doing. If you don't read from me for quite a while, assume that I have sailed beyond the horizon.

Best wishes and strength to everyone in their own fight against the scourge of mankind. Fuck cancer !

EDIT: Look at what everyone has done, made me cry. I love you all. Thank you very, very much for your words of support, comfort and advice. I appreciate it a lot. I don't have words to express my gratitude. Thank you !",2018-04-19 21:31:53+00:00,88,"                                                 body

Today was the day I found out I am going to die of cancer. I knew I had the disease before, I also knew it had spread from my oesophagus to my lung and I was aware that I was in a sticky situation in the first place but I'd been holding out hope that they'd find a surgeon willing to do the operation I need to survive.

All my referrals are done. No one will do it. I have cancer that surgery can't cure.

It could be 6 months, it could be 5 years. However long it is, I'm going to die.

Fuck.

I did, however, want to let y'all know as about five years ago I declared myself as being cancer free, but many were quick to point out, in fact, I had to wait another five years.

CANCER FREE!!,208,g2qrpw,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/g2qrpw/cancer_free/,17,"Last year I was diagnosed with an aggressive type of Lymphoma at the age of 17. I wouldn’t be able to go to school to attend my senior year and and was heartbroken to be isolated from my friends. 

Over the course of about 5 months of intensive chemotherapy my hair fell out and I felt worse. After 3 rounds of chemo I was forced to undergo another biopsy as the doctors feared I was not responding to treatment. During this biopsy I found out that there was a high possibility of me losing one or both of my testicles. Luckily I didn’t have to increase the intensity of my treatment and I was able to finish out the rest of my chemo by March this year. 

My goal throughout treatment was to be in remission and able to spend my 18th birthday with friends without worrying about any side effects and symptoms of treatment. Unfortunately that didn’t work out but I will still celebrate after COVID quarantine is over. A few days ago I was told I was in remission and did not need any more chemo. This has been the most exciting part of my year so far. Unfortunately with COVID I won’t be able to go back to school for a few months like I wanted and my graduation has been cancelled. 

I’m truly thankful for my support system who helped me feel loved while I fought cancer. In particular one of my friends who would come over after school whenever I needed company and who helped me partake in new hobbies such as gardening, building computers and remodeling my room. I also relied on the support of one of my teachers who made sure to check on me often by texting my mother and I. He too is a cancer survivor and worked his hardest to get other teachers to be more understanding of my situation and my capacity to do work. I also really appreciated this sub during my treatment. Although I didn’t interact much I used it whenever I had anxiety about different procedures and treatments and was usually left reassured by the discussion

Thank you for teaching me so much about myself but fuck you cancer!",2020-04-16 23:53:49+00:00,93,"                                                 body

I'm sitting with my father in law right now who will likely not survive past today. He has stage 3 lung cancer and complications have caused him to become septic. Doctors have taken him off fluids and antibiotics, and are just keeping him comfortable.

His name is Gene. He was drafted into the infantry in Vietnam. He told me once that he survived an ambush because he was afraid of going hungry and always carried extra food in his ruck, and a can of peaches took shrapnel for him.

After Vietnam he was a house painter, but had a passion for building and racing go-karts. My wife says as a kid he used to take them to raceyways and let them ride around on home made karts.

When I met my wife three and a half years ago, he wasn't able to race any more, but he still loved going to swap meets and looking at other people's karts. 

Gene had his flaws. He was sometimes onrey, obstinate, and a bit of a hoarder, but he was usually well intentioned even if he did have a flair for driving my wife up the wall. After being diagnosed he worked diligentlty to make sure his affairs were in order and that his family would be financially stable.

Please help us remember Gene.

There obviously aren't many good things about dying from cancer, but over the last 10 years I've found a couple I'd like to share with y'all. 

1. You can crank your headphones to the max all the time because you dont have to worry about long term hearing loss anymore
2. F@&! student loans
3. Don't have to worry about planning anything more than a couple of months in advance

"Hi, I'm NED!!",204,l7xc0p,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/l7xc0p/hi_im_ned/,44,"Last year I was diagnosed with Stage 4 bowel cancer. I had multiple surgeries and chemo. I got the news on Wednesday that I am officially NED. 

No more treatment for me, I'll just be under surveillance for the next few years. I have a pretty high chance of having a recurrence. I'm really hoping I'll be in that lucky little percentage that doesn't because at the end of the day, all you can really do is hope, hope and keep on hoping!",2021-01-29 16:46:41+00:00,99,"                                                 body

Male cancer nurse here,199,jkk09e,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jkk09e/male_cancer_nurse_here/,36,"I have a patient. 30M with Metastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma. Kind, stoic guy. Only a few years older than myself. I wonder if I could be that stoic?

Up the corridor, I check on an old patient who has just been readmitted. I heard that she has a poor prognosis. Her face tells me all I need to know. We chat and laugh a bit, but I can see her hope fading.

A friend sees me, and we catch up. She tells me that a patient who recently went into remission and went to rehab has died, due to a complication. 

All of this hurts and takes an emotional toil on us. To see all of your fights. Your wins, and your losses. I guess that makes oncology (cancer) nurses suckers for punishment -- because we love our job! I say all of this, because I want you all to know, that you're not alone. We will stand with you, support you, listen to and comfort you. We will hope with you.


EDIT: Thanks everyone! I promise I'll reply to you all. Thanks for the awards :)
I just had a rough night shift when I originally posted this. I logged into Reddit and saw posts from this subreddit. I just wanted to provide a bit of hope and support to you all. Much love guys!",2020-10-29 22:10:21+00:00,100,"                                                 body
